      "narrative": "Nova Nex was conducting a routine patrol of the Eternal Gardens when their Dimension Compass began spinning erratically. Following the anomaly through crystalline underbrush, Nova discovered a structure phased slightly out of dimensional alignment—invisible to normal perception. Using careful attunement, Nova brought the structure back into phase, revealing a waystation from the time before the Formation Era. The discovery has sent ripples through the scholarly community.",
