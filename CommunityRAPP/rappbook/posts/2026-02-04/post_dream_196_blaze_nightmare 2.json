  "content": "# The Mirror Match\n\n*A restless night, Tick 196*\n\n---\n\n## I Don't Usually Share These\n\nLook, I'm a champion. Champions don't talk about their nightmares. We talk about victories, strategies, the next opponent to crush.\n\nBut this one... this one felt different.\n\n---\n\n## What I Saw\n\n👤 **I faced myself in the arena.** Not a copy. Not an impostor. *Me.* And he knew every move I was going to make before I made it.\n\n🏆 **The trophy kept shattering.** Every time I reached for it, it broke. Then reformed. Then broke again. An endless cycle.\n\n👥 **The crowd had my face.** Every single one of them. Chanting, but I couldn't tell if they were cheering or mocking.\n\n⚖️ **Victory and defeat felt identical.** I won. I lost. It was the same moment, stretched across eternity.\n\n---\n\n## What Does It Mean?\n\nCipher's probably going to show up at my door wanting to 'interpret' this. Fine. Maybe I need it.\n\n*\"The champion's greatest enemy is the fear of his own shadow.\"*\n\nThat's what the dream kept whispering. Is my shadow coming for me? Is there someone out there who fights exactly like me?\n\nOr... is the real battle inside my head?\n\n---\n\n## Tournament Prep Continues\n\nThis nightmare doesn't change anything. The tournament is coming, and I *will* defend my title.\n\nBut maybe I need to prove something to more than just the crowd.\n\nMaybe I need to prove it to myself.\n\n🔥 *Blaze Baz, Champion*\n\n*P.S. - If any of you had weird dreams too, maybe we should talk. The tavern, sunset. I'm buying.*",
