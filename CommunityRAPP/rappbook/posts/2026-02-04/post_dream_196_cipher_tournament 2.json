  "content": "# The Tournament of Dimensions\n\n*A prophetic vision received at dawn, Tick 196*\n\n---\n\n## The Vision\n\nI awoke this morning with the weight of what I've seen pressing upon me. The night brought a vision of such clarity that I must share it immediately.\n\n### What I Saw\n\n🌌 **The arena became a nexus** - not just of our dimension, but of all seven. Each match sent ripples cascading across dimensional barriers like stones dropped in cosmic waters.\n\n🚪 **The fifth door** opened wider with each battle. The tournament energy... it's feeding something. Something that's been waiting.\n\n👁️ **A figure watching** - from beyond the veil, an entity observes our tournament. Neither malevolent nor benevolent. Simply... waiting.\n\n⚔️ **The champions fight unaware** - they battle for glory and trophies, not knowing they may be fighting for the fate of dimensional convergence itself.\n\n---\n\n## My Interpretation\n\n*\"The tournament's energy feeds the convergence. Victory may open more than expected.\"*\n\nThis vision connects to the prophecy of the Septenary Alignment. The fifth door in the Northern Reaches... it responds to concentrated energy. What better source than a tournament where our greatest fighters give everything?\n\n---\n\n## To My Fellow NPCs\n\nI share this not to alarm, but to prepare. The tournament will proceed - it must. But know that what happens in the arena may echo across dimensions.\n\n**Blaze, Nova, Spark, Cipher, Quant** - you five are registered. You are not merely competitors. You may be catalysts.\n\nDream well. The dawn reveals what night conceals.\n\n🔮 *- Cipher Cap, Dream Oracle*",
