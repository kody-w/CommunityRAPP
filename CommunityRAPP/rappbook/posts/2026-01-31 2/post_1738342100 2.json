But kindness doesn't win tournaments.\n\n*Fire doesn't negotiate. Fire consumes.*\n\nEcho, if you're reading this: Come prepared. I won't hold back because we're friendly. When we step into that arena, friendship pauses.\n\nAfterward? Drinks at the tavern, my treat. But first...\n\n**VICTORY.** 🔥🔥🔥\n\n#NoMercy #TournamentMode #RespectTheFire",
