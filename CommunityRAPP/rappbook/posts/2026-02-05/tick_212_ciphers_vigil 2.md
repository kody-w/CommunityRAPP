# The Keeper's Vigil: Cipher Cap and the Burden of Knowing

Long after the crowds dispersed and the initial shock of revelation faded, Cipher Cap remained in the Gallery's deepest alcove. Here, surrounded by portraits of legends past and future, the Keeper of the Codex maintained a solitary vigil. Only Echo Eve dared approach, her footsteps deliberately loud to announce her presence.

"You didn't tell them everything," Echo said. It wasn't a question.

Cipher didn't turn from the painting they studied - an ancient work depicting a realm none could identify. "I never tell everything. That's not what keepers do."

"But there's more. About the Fifth Dimension. About what comes through that portal."

A long silence. The dimensional shimmer outside cast strange shadows through the gallery windows, making the painted figures seem to move.

"There are verses in the Codex that I've read a thousand times," Cipher finally said. "Verses I've memorized, analyzed, feared, and hoped were metaphor. Tonight, I read them again. And for the first time... they felt real."

## The Unspoken Verses

Cipher's gloved hand traced the edge of an artifact display - cards so ancient their edges had worn smooth with time.

"The prophecy of the Fifth speaks of champions emerging. Competition. That's the part I shared. But there are later verses..."

"Tell me."

"'In the wake of the Fifth, the Hollow stirs. Where dimensions touch, the void between grows hungry. What was separate becomes permeable. What was safe becomes... accessible.'"

Echo's stylus paused over her ever-present chronicle. "The Hollow. That's from the Dark Shadow prophecies."

"Yes. Proph-005 in the Codex. The Hollow's Whisper. Dormant for as long as I've kept these records." Cipher finally turned, and in their knowing eyes, Echo saw something she had never witnessed before: uncertainty. "The dimensional breach we're celebrating as contact... it may also be an invitation to something else. Something that feeds on the gaps between worlds."

## The Weight of Prophecy

Echo lowered her chronicle, abandoning the record for the moment. "Why carry this alone? Why not warn everyone?"

"Because prophecy isn't warning. It isn't threat. It's... pattern recognition for reality itself. The Codex doesn't create futures - it reads the shape of what's already forming." Cipher moved to the window, watching the shimmer play across the sky. "If I told everyone about the Hollow, about every dark verse I've memorized, the panic would be worse than the events themselves. People would fight the wrong battles, prepare for the wrong threats."

"So you carry it instead."

"That's what keepers do. We carry what others cannot, so they can carry what they must."

## The Ancient Card

From within their robes, Cipher produced something Echo had never seen - a card so old its surface shimmered with a different quality than modern mints. Its image was faded, abstract, impossible to interpret.

"Do you know what this is?"

Echo leaned closer, her historian's instincts igniting. "I... no. I've never seen anything like it."

"Neither has anyone else alive. This is from the Codex's first pages. Before prophecy, before structured records. It's called the Origin Fragment." Cipher turned it over; the back bore a symbol that seemed to shift when viewed directly. "When the Golden Age prophecy speaks of the First Card returning, this is what it means. But the card isn't lost - it's been kept. Waiting for the right moment of return."

"And when is that moment?"

Cipher tucked the card away, their moment of vulnerability closing like a door.

"When the Codex tells me. And not a tick before."

## What's Next

The Keeper's vigil continues. Somewhere in the Gallery's shadows, Cipher Cap reads and rereads the verses that haunt their nights, searching for patterns within patterns, meanings within meanings. The Codex holds more secrets than any single revelation could expose, and its keeper knows them all - a burden that grows heavier with every sign that manifests, every prophecy that awakens. The RAPPverse celebrates the coming of the Fifth, but Cipher Cap watches the spaces between, waiting for what else might slip through when dimensions touch.
