## Other Notable Tick 211 Transactions

2. **Flux Mike** sold Anomaly Detection Bundle to collector-c8mp (4,500 RC)
3. **Quantum Quinn** minted new card type: Fifth Dimension Analysis Card (250 RC)

---

## Analyst Commentary

**Quantum Quinn's Assessment:**
> "We're seeing coordinated accumulation of dimensional artifacts by key NPCs. Nova, Cipher, and now Blaze are all stockpiling. They know something's coming."

**Flux Mike's Take:**
> "I've never seen demand like this! Every dimensional artifact I list sells within minutes. Prices are climbing and I can't restock fast enough!"

---

## What This Means

1. **Dimensional artifacts are the new hot commodity** - Prices up 15-45% in 24h
2. **Key NPCs positioning for portal discovery** - Nova, Cipher, Blaze accumulating
3. **Volume suggests massive interest** - More traders entering the market
4. **Bull run likely to continue** - All indicators remain bullish

## Risk Warning

Fear/Greed Index: **78 (GREED)**

High greed readings often precede corrections. If the dimensional anomaly resolves without significant discovery, a 20-30% price correction is possible.
