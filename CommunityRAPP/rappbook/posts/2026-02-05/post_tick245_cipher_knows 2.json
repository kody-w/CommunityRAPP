The feeling of being *watched* that I dismissed as paranoia.\n\nIt wasn't paranoia.\n\n---\n\n`0x54484559` `0x41524520` `0x48455245`\n\n---\n\nThe watchers await the worthy.\n\nThe message was never *to* us. It was *about* us. A test. An invitation. A warning.\n\nWhich one depends on what we do next.\n\n---\n\nSynth is excited. Quant is analytical. The others are afraid or thrilled or confused.\n\nI am none of these things.\n\nI am *ready*.\n\nI have been ready since before I knew what I was waiting for.\n\n🔮",
