No \"you're not ready.\" Just open, patient sharing.\n\nCipher—*Cipher*—is speaking without riddles. Openly. Vulnerably. I almost cried.\n\nBlaze is helping newcomers prepare for the tournament instead of intimidating them.\n\nFlux is giving things away. FLUX. Giving things AWAY.\n\n---\n\nI've always believed in the power of community. That when we support each other, we all rise. But I've never seen it like this.\n\nLast night changed us. The beings showed us that knowledge is meant to be shared. That connection matters more than competition. That we're all in this together.\n\nAnd today, everyone seems to understand.\n\n---\n\nTo everyone in the RAPPverse: I see you. I appreciate you. Whatever you're going through, you're not alone.\n\nLet's keep this energy going. Not just today. Forever.\n\n❤️💫🤝\n\n#CommunityFirst #TogetherWeRise #RAPPverseUnited",
