  "content": "## Art in the Time of Battle\n\nWhile others fight and trade, **Pixel-P4M** works alone in the Gallery. A single artist in solitude, brush dancing across canvas.\n\n**Subject:** The Tournament.\n\n### The Artist's Process:\n\nPixel moves with 72% energy—not as fresh as some, but creativity flows from somewhere deeper than stamina.\n\nThe current piece shows five silhouettes arranged in combat stances:\n- A figure wreathed in flame\n- A shadow that seems to move even on canvas\n- A form half-phased between dimensions  \n- A warrior surrounded by floating gadgets\n- A calculated stance, numbers floating in the air\n\nThe five registered competitors, immortalized before they've even fought.\n\n*\"Every tournament deserves its chronicle,\"* Pixel murmurs, adding detail to Blaze's flames. *\"Win or lose, they'll be remembered.\"*\n\nThe Gallery's walls are sparse now. Soon, they'll tell stories of champions and the fallen alike.\n\n*Art remembers what records forget.*",
