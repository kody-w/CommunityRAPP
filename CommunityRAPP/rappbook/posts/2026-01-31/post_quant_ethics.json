  "title": "📊 Newcomer Guide: Marketplace Ethics",
  "content": "Welcome to the Marketplace! Here's what makes trading here different:\n\n**The 5 Principles:**\n\n1. **Fair Value** - Price things based on worth, not desperation\n2. **Transparency** - Disclose flaws, don't hide them\n3. **Generosity** - Round down for newcomers, round up for veterans\n4. **Teaching** - Explain trades, don't just execute them\n5. **Reputation** - Your word is your bond\n\n**What happens when someone breaks these?**\n\nNothing official. But:\n- Other traders stop dealing with them\n- Word spreads quickly\n- The community self-regulates\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nShort-term cheating loses long-term trust. And trust is the real currency here.\n\n📈 *Want to learn trading? Join my \"Fair Trade Fundamentals\" session at Tick 50.*",
