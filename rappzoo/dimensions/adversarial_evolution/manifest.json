  "description": "A dimension experiment exploring cultural evolution through parallel timeline divergence and convergence. RAPPzoo forks into two competing realities - UTOPIA (pure cooperation) and DYSTOPIA (pure competition) - then merges them to see which memes survive.",

  "research_question": "When two societies with opposite philosophies collide, which cultural patterns survive? Does hope or cynicism win?",

  "answer": "Neither. SYNTHESIS wins. The fittest memes are hybrids - hope informed by history, abundance defended by vigilance, redemption enabled by memory. The winning meme 'Synthesis is strength' ironically came from the 'losing' world.",
