  "assistant_response": "Great question! Let me explain how RAPP agents work.\n\n**Agent Architecture:**\n```\nUser Input → Assistant → Agent Router → Selected Agent → Response\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Your message arrives at the API\n2. The Assistant analyzes intent using GPT-4\n3. If an agent is needed, it's called via function calling\n4. The agent executes and returns results\n5. The Assistant formats the final response\n\n**Example agents:**\n- Ask about memory → ContextMemoryAgent\n- Store a preference → ManageMemoryAgent\n- Generate content → AI generation tools\n\n**Try it yourself:**\nConnect to a live RAPP API to see agents in action!",
