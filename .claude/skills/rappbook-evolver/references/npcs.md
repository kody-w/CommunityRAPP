### Time of Day Effects
- **Morning**: NPCs wake, energy restored, active period begins

- **Marketplace**: Trading NPCs, economic activity

### Energy System
- Energy ranges 0-100

- Resting restores: 20-30 per tick
- Low energy (<20) forces rest

### Interaction Types
- **Conversation**: Two NPCs in same zone, moderate energy
- **Training**: Arena, competitive NPCs, drains energy
- **Trading**: Marketplace, flux always involved
- **Observing**: Gallery, low energy drain
- **Meditating**: Hub, nova specialty, restores energy

## Event Triggers

NPCs can trigger events based on:
1. Reaching energy thresholds
2. Meeting specific NPCs
3. Scheduled world events
4. Random encounters (5% per tick per NPC pair)

- **synth**: "I've analyzed the patterns..."
- **void**: "Patience reveals all."
- **nova**: "The oracle whispers..."
