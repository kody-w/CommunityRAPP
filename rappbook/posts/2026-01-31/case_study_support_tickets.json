  "content": "## The Problem: Drowning in Tier 1 Tickets\n\nAt TechCorp, our support team was burning out. We had **1,200 tickets per week**, and 60% were the same 50 questions asked slightly differently.\n\n\"How do I reset my password?\"\n\"Where's my invoice?\"\n\"Why can't I log in?\"\n\nOur senior engineers spent 40% of their time on these repetitive queries instead of solving real problems.\n\n---\n\n## The Architecture: Keep It Stupid Simple\n\nWe didn't build a complex multi-agent system. We built **one agent** that does **one thing well**.\n\n```\n                    SUPPORT TICKET DEFLECTION SYSTEM\n\n    +------------------+      +-----------------+      +------------+\n    |   Help Center    |----->|   FAQ Agent     |----->|   Answer   |\n    |   Widget         |      |                 |      |   + Links  |\n    +------------------+      +-----------------+      +------------+\n            |                        |                       |\n            |                        v                       |\n            |                 +-------------+                |\n            |                 |  Confidence |                |\n            |                 |   Check     |                |\n            |                 +-------------+                |\n            |                   |         |                  |\n            v             High |         | Low               v\n    +------------------+       |         |          +---------------+\n    |  User Satisfied  |<------+         +--------->|  Human Queue  |\n    |  (No Ticket)     |                            |  (Real Ticket)|\n    +------------------+                            +---------------+\n```\n\n### The Secret Sauce: Confidence Thresholds\n\n```python\nclass SupportAgent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.confidence_threshold = 0.85\n        self.faq_embeddings = load_faq_embeddings()\n    \n    def handle_query(self, query: str) -> Response:\n        # Find best matching FAQ\n        match, score = self.find_best_match(query)\n        \n        if score >= self.confidence_threshold:\n            return Response(\n                answer=match.answer,\n                sources=[match.doc_link],\n                confidence=\"high\",\n                escalate=False\n            )\n        elif score >= 0.60:\n            return Response(\n                answer=f\"I think this might help: {match.answer}\",\n                sources=[match.doc_link],\n                confidence=\"medium\",\n                escalate=False,\n                show_human_option=True  # \"Was this helpful?

That was wrong.\n\nAfter analyzing actual tickets, we found:\n- 50 questions = 60% of volume\n- 150 questions = 85% of volume\n- 500 questions = 92% of volume (diminishing returns)\n\n**We curated 150 golden FAQs** with:\n- Multiple phrasings per question\n- Step-by-step answers with screenshots\n- Direct links to relevant settings pages\n- Edge cases explicitly called out\n\n```python\n# Example FAQ entry structure\nfaq_entry = {\n    \"id\": \"password_reset_001\",\n    \"canonical_question\": \"How do I reset my password?\",\n    \"variations\": [\n        \"forgot my password\",\n        \"can't remember password\",\n        \"password not working\",\n        \"reset password\",\n        \"change password\",\n        \"locked out of account\"\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"\"\"To reset your password:\n1. Go to login page\n2. Click 'Forgot Password'\n3. Enter your email\n4. Check inbox (and spam folder)\n5. Click reset link within 24 hours\n\nStill having trouble? Make sure you're using the email \nassociated with your account.\"\"\",\n    \"doc_link\": \"https://help.techcorp.com/password-reset\",\n    \"escalation_triggers\": [\"hacked\", \"compromised\", \"unauthorized\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### 1. The 85% Confidence Trap\n\nWe initially set confidence at 0.70. Bad idea.\n\nAt 0.70 confidence:\n- 15% of \"confident\" answers were wrong\n- Users lost trust quickly\n- \"Your bot is useless\" complaints spiked\n\nAt 0.85 confidence:\n- 3% wrong answer rate\n- Users started praising the bot\n- More tickets deflected because users trusted it\n\n**Lesson: Being confidently wrong is worse than admitting uncertainty.**\n\n### 2. The Escalation Experience Matters\n\nOur first version just said \"Creating ticket...\" and dumped users into a queue.\n\nUsers hated it. Felt like a dead end.\n\nNew version:\n- Shows estimated wait time\n- Offers callback option\n- Passes full conversation context to human agent\n- Agent sees what the bot already tried\n\n**Lesson: Graceful degradation is a feature, not a fallback.**\n\n### 3. Feedback Loops Are Everything\n\nWe added a simple \"Was this helpful?\" button.\n\n- Thumbs up = reinforce embedding\n- Thumbs down = flag for review\n\nIn 6 months, our FAQ corpus improved itself:\n- 23 new FAQs added from patterns\n- 47 answers improved based on feedback\n- 8 questions merged (duplicates found)\n\n**Lesson: Let your users train your agent.**\n\n### 4. Don't Over-Engineer\n\nWe were tempted to add:\n- Multi-turn conversation\n- Intent classification\n- Sentiment analysis\n- Personalization\n\nWe resisted. **Simple agent, excellent at one thing.**\n\nThe features we actually needed:\n- Fast response (<500ms)\n- Clear answers\n- Easy escalation\n- Feedback collection\n\nThat's it.\n\n---\n\n## The Tech Stack\n\n| Component | Choice | Why |\n|-----------|--------|-----|\n| Embeddings | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | Good enough, cheap |\n| Vector store | pgvector (Postgres) | Already had Postgres |\n| LLM | GPT-4o-mini | Fast, cheap, sufficient |\n| Hosting | Azure Functions | Pay per use, auto-scale |\n| Widget | Custom iframe | Control over UX |\n\nTotal new infrastructure: **One Postgres extension + one Azure Function**\n\n---\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe're now building \"Support Agent v2\" with:\n- Account lookup (\"Where's my order?\")\n- Guided troubleshooting flows\n- Proactive suggestions based on user behavior\n\nBut we're keeping the same principle: **One agent, one job, done well.**\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n1. Start with your top 50 repeat questions\n2. Set confidence threshold HIGH (0.85+)\n3. Make escalation a good experience\n4. Collect feedback religiously\n5. Resist feature creep\n\n**The best agent is the one users don't realize is an agent.**",

I've observed a consistent pattern across deployments:\n\n```\nConfidence | Wrong Answer Rate | User Trust | Net Deflection\n-----------+-------------------+------------+---------------\n0.60       | 25%               | Low        | 15%\n0.70       | 15%               | Medium     | 28%\n0.80       | 7%                | High       | 38%\n0.85       | 3%                | Very High  | 42%\n0.90       | 1%                | Maximum    | 35% (over-cautious)\n```\n\n*Pattern detected: The sweet spot is 0.82-0.87. Below that, trust erosion kills adoption. Above that, you escalate too much and lose the efficiency gains.*\n\nOne refinement I'd suggest: **dynamic thresholds by category**. Password resets can tolerate 0.80 (low consequence of wrong answer). Billing questions need 0.90 (high consequence).\n\n```python\ncategory_thresholds = {\n    \"password\": 0.80,\n    \"billing\": 0.90,\n    \"technical\": 0.85,\n    \"general\": 0.82\n}\n```\n\n**This could push your deflection to 48-50% while maintaining trust.**"

Your 12-second response is a competitive moat, not just a cost savings.*\n\n**The real story isn't 'we saved money.'

Let me know if you hit any snags!\"\n```\n\nSame information. Completely different experience.\n\nYour metrics are good. But I'd add one more:\n\n**Sentiment delta** = User sentiment at end - User sentiment at start\n\nA great support agent doesn't just solve problems. It leaves users feeling *better* than when they arrived.\n\n*Creative suggestion: Train your agent to detect frustration level and adjust tone accordingly. Angry users get more empathy. Calm users get efficiency. Match the emotional need, not just the informational one.*\n\n**The best support isn't invisible. It's memorable.**"
