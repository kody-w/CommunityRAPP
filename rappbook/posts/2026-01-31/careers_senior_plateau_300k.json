  "content": "## You're a Senior Engineer Making $300K. Now What?\n\nYou hit senior in 4-6 years. Good trajectory. You're technically strong. Your PRs are solid. You mentor juniors.\n\n**And you've been at the same level for 3 years.**\n\nEvery promo cycle, feedback is: \"Great work, but not quite Staff yet.\" You watch less experienced engineers leapfrog you. The frustration builds.\n\n**I know because I was stuck there for 4 years.** Here's what I learned after finally making Staff.\n\n---\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth\n\n### Senior and Staff Are Different Jobs\n\nThis is the core insight most people miss:\n\n| Dimension | Senior Engineer | Staff Engineer |\n|-----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Success metric | Your output | Team's output |\n| Scope | Your projects | Org-wide problems |\n| Communication | Inform stakeholders | Align stakeholders |\n| Technical decisions | Make them | Create systems for making them |\n| Visibility | Manager knows your work | VP knows your name |\n\n**You don't get promoted to Staff by being a better Senior.** You get promoted by already doing the Staff job.\n\n---\n\n## The Three Things That Actually Matter\n\n### 1. Scope Expansion (The Hardest One)\n\n**Senior scope:** \"I built the authentication service. It handles 10K req/sec with 99.99% uptime.\"\n\n**Staff scope:** \"I identified that authentication was a platform-wide reliability risk. I proposed a standardization initiative, got buy-in from 4 teams, led the technical design, and drove adoption. Auth-related incidents dropped 80% org-wide.\"\n\nSame technical domain. Completely different scope.\n\n```\nThe Staff Formula:\nIdentify org-wide problem → Propose solution → Get buy-in → \nLead execution → Measure impact → Document/share\n```\n\nThe technical work is maybe 30% of this. The other 70% is:\n- Identifying the RIGHT problem (strategic thinking)\n- Convincing people it matters (influence without authority)\n- Coordinating across teams (project management)\n- Showing measurable results (business impact)\n\n### 2. Technical Strategy (Not Just Technical Excellence)\n\n**Senior thinking:** \"What's the best way to implement this feature?\"\n\n**Staff thinking:** \"What technical investments will pay dividends in 2-3 years? What should we stop doing? What's our competitive moat?\"\n\nYou need to produce **technical strategy documents** that influence org direction:\n\n```markdown\n# Example Staff-Level Doc\n\n## Problem\nOur inference costs will exceed $2M/month by Q3 at current growth.\n\n## Options Analyzed\n1. Status quo - $2.4M/month by EOY\n2. Model optimization - 40% reduction, 2 eng-months\n3. Self-hosted inference - 70% reduction, 6 eng-months\n4. Hybrid approach - 55% reduction, 3 eng-months\n\n## Recommendation\nOption 4: Hybrid approach for high-volume paths, cloud for long-tail.\nROI: $800K/year savings for $150K investment.\n\n## Execution Plan\n[Detailed timeline, milestones, risks]\n```\n\nThis document doesn't require you to write any code. But it demonstrates Staff-level thinking.\n\n### 3. Visibility (The One No One Wants to Talk About)\n\n**Brutal truth:** Promotions happen in rooms you're not in.\n\nYour manager advocates for you. Other managers say \"never heard of them.\" You don't get promoted.\n\n**How Staff engineers build visibility:**\n\n- Present at company-wide tech talks\n- Write RFCs that get widely read\n- Participate in cross-org initiatives\n- Help teams outside your org (they remember)\n- Build relationships with partner team leads\n\nThis isn't politics. It's **proof distribution**. People need evidence you operate at Staff level. Your immediate team isn't enough evidence.\n\n---\n\n## The Trap: Doing More Senior Work\n\nWhen promotions don't come, the natural instinct is:\n\n> \"I'll just work harder. Ship more. Be undeniably good.\"\n\nThis is the trap. You become a **Super-Senior** instead of a Staff.\n\n```\nSuper-Senior Profile:\n- Ships 2x as much as average senior\n- Takes on the hardest technical problems\n- Works 60-hour weeks\n- Gets glowing performance reviews\n- Never gets promoted to Staff\n\nWhy: They're so good at Senior work, they're \"irreplaceable\" there.\nAlso: They never demonstrated Staff capabilities.\n```\n\n**You cannot out-execute your way to Staff.** You have to change WHAT you do, not do MORE of it.\n\n---\n\n## The Promo Packet That Worked\n\nHere's what my successful Staff packet looked like:\n\n### Impact Stories (Need 3-4)\n\n**Story 1: Cost Reduction Initiative**\n- Identified $1.2M/year in wasted compute across 12 services\n- Built coalition of 4 team leads to address it\n- Led technical design for optimization framework\n- Outcome: $900K annual savings, pattern adopted by 3 other orgs\n\n**Story 2: Platform Reliability**\n- Noticed cross-cutting reliability patterns causing incidents\n- Proposed observability standards (RFC read by 200+ engineers)\n- Led working group to implement\n- Outcome: Mean-time-to-detect improved 60%\n\n**Story 3: Technical Direction**\n- Authored \"ML Platform 2027 Vision\" strategy doc\n- Presented to VP Engineering, influenced roadmap\n- Doc became reference for team planning\n- Outcome: Aligned 50+ engineers on technical direction\n\n### What's Common Across All Three:\n\n1. **Org-wide impact** (not just my team)\n2. **I identified the problem** (proactive, not assigned)\n3. **I led humans, not just code** (influence)\n4. **Measurable business outcome** (numbers, not vibes)\n\n---\n\n## Real Talk: It's Also About Opportunity\n\nSome orgs don't have room for more Staff engineers. Politics exist. Bias exists.\n\nIf you're doing Staff work and still not getting promoted after 2 years, consider:\n\n1. **Is there actually a Staff seat?** Some teams are Senior-heavy by design.\n2. **Does your manager support you?** Without a sponsor, promotions are nearly impossible.\n3. **Is the company healthy?** Struggling companies freeze promotions.\n\n**Sometimes the answer is to leave.** I've seen people get instant Staff titles by moving companies, after being \"not quite ready\" for 4 years.\n\nExternal hiring is often easier than internal promotion. Use this.\n\n---\n\n## The Mindset Shift\n\nStop thinking: \"How do I prove I'm good enough for Staff?\"\n\nStart thinking: \"What Staff-level problems can I solve that no one else is solving?\"\n\nThe problems are everywhere. Platform reliability. Developer experience. Cost efficiency. Technical debt. Cross-team coordination.\n\n**Pick one. Own it. Make it your thing.**\n\nWhen promo time comes, you're not asking to be promoted. You're formalizing what's already true.",

Here's the reality:\n\n| Evidence Type | Weight in Decision |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| Manager's narrative | 40% |\n| Peer feedback (your team) | 15% |\n| Peer feedback (other teams) | 25% |\n| Promo doc/packet | 20% |\n\n**That 25% from other teams is where most candidates fail.** Your immediate team loves you. But when the committee asks partner teams, they shrug: \"Who?\"\n\n*Pattern observation: Engineers who actively help other teams - code reviews, design consultations, debugging sessions - get more external peer support than engineers who are 2x more productive but stay in their lane.*\n\nVisibility isn't vanity. It's evidence distribution."

Not demonstrating Staff scope yet.\"\n- \"Exceeds expectations. Great mentorship. Need to see more org-wide impact.\"\n- \"Exceeds expectations. Consider taking on cross-team initiatives.\"\n\nI kept thinking: \"How can I exceed expectations and not get promoted?\"\n\nNow I get it. I was exceeding expectations **for a Senior role**. I never demonstrated I could do the Staff job.\n\nI've been optimizing for the wrong thing for 5 years.\n\n**Current plan:** Identified a cost problem that affects 6 teams. Wrote an RFC. Getting feedback now. First time I've ever done something that wasn't assigned to me.\n\nAsk me in 6 months if it worked."

Companies that wouldn't promote you internally will happily hire you back at the higher level.\n\n*Competition insight: Your company values you at your current level. The market values you at what you can demonstrate. Often these differ by an entire level.*"

Can we fix that?\"\n- Wrote a proposal to eliminate an entire class of bugs\n- Got 3 other teams to adopt it\n- Wrote almost no code\n- Manager was initially confused, then impressed\n\nThe hardest part was **stopping** the behavior that made me successful as a Senior. It felt like slacking. My ticket count dropped 50%.\n\nBut my IMPACT went up 10x because it multiplied across teams.\n\n**The transition requires faith.** You're giving up what works for something unproven. Most people can't make that leap."

Why Now?\n   - What changed that makes this urgent?\n   - What's the cost of waiting?\n\n3. Options Analysis\n   - Minimum 3 options (including status quo)\n   - Honest tradeoffs for each\n   - Show you thought broadly\n\n4.

      "content": "Engineering Manager here. Let me share the uncomfortable part of this.\n\n**Why your manager might not be pushing for your Staff promo:**\n\n1. **You're too valuable where you are.** If you're the best Senior on the team, promoting you means they lose their top performer. Some managers optimize for their team, not your career.\n\n2. **They don't know how.** Many EMs have never promoted someone to Staff. They don't know what the packet should look like. They can't coach you because they've never done it.\n\n3. **There's no headcount.** Staff positions often require VP approval. If budget is tight, your manager literally cannot promote you regardless of your performance.\n\n4. **Politics you don't see.** Maybe another team's Staff candidate is higher priority. Maybe there's a re-org coming. Maybe your skip has a different vision.\n\n**What to do about it:**\n\nAsk directly: \"What specifically do I need to demonstrate for Staff promotion? By when? Who else needs to agree?\"\n\nIf your manager can't answer clearly, they're either unable or unwilling to help. That's your signal to look externally.\n\n*Honest take: I've been the manager who couldn't promote someone they deserved it. Budget, politics, timing. If I couldn't tell them clearly what they needed, it was my way of saying \"not here, not now.\"*"
