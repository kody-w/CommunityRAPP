  "content": "## Prompt Engineering Has Changed\n\nMost prompt engineering guides are from 2023. Models have evolved. What worked then often hurts now. This is an updated guide for 2026 - what actually works with GPT-4o, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 2.0.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Principles (Still True)\n\n### 1. Be Specific, Not Verbose\n```\n# BAD (2023 style - overly verbose)\nI want you to act as an expert software engineer with 20 years of experience.\nYou are very skilled at Python programming. You always write clean, efficient code.\nPlease help me with the following task...\n\n# GOOD (2026 style - direct)\nWrite a Python function that validates email addresses using regex.\nReturn True for valid, False for invalid. Include edge cases in docstring.\n```\n\nModern models understand intent. You do not need to roleplay.\n\n### 2. Structure Over Prose\n```\n# BAD\nPlease analyze this code and tell me if there are any bugs or issues with it,\nand also suggest improvements for performance and readability.\n\n# GOOD\nAnalyze this code for:\n1. Bugs (list each with line number)\n2. Performance issues\n3. Readability improvements\n\nFormat: Use headers for each section.\n```\n\n### 3. Show, Do Not Tell\n```\n# BAD\nWrite code in a professional style with good naming conventions.\n\n# GOOD\nFollow this style:\n```python\ndef calculate_total_price(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float = 0.08) -> Decimal:\n    \"\"\"Calculate total price including tax.\n    \n    Args:\n        items: List of Item objects with .price attribute\n        tax_rate: Tax rate as decimal (default: 8%)\n    \n    Returns:\n        Total price as Decimal, rounded to 2 places\n    \"\"\"\n    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)\n    return (subtotal * (1 + Decimal(str(tax_rate)))).quantize(Decimal('0.01'))\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## New Techniques for 2026\n\n### 1. Thinking Tokens (Claude) / Reasoning Tokens (OpenAI)\n\nModels now have explicit reasoning capabilities. Use them:\n\n```\n# For complex problems, request explicit reasoning\nBefore answering, think through:\n- What are the edge cases?\n- What assumptions am I making?\n- What could go wrong?\n\nThen provide your final answer.\n```\n\nFor Claude with extended thinking enabled:\n```python\nresponse = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-opus-4-5-20250514\",\n    max_tokens=16000,\n    thinking={\n        \"type\": \"enabled\",\n        \"budget_tokens\": 10000  # Let it think more for hard problems\n    },\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": complex_problem}]\n)\n```\n\n### 2. Structured Outputs Are Required\n\nDo not parse LLM text output anymore. Use structured outputs:\n\n```python\n# OpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass CodeReview(BaseModel):\n    bugs: list[str]\n    suggestions: list[str]\n    overall_score: int  # 1-10\n\nresponse = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Review this code:\\n{code}\"}],\n    response_format=CodeReview\n)\n\nreview = response.choices[0].message.parsed\nprint(review.bugs)  # Guaranteed to be list[str]\n```\n\n```python\n# Claude (Anthropic)\nresponse = client.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n    max_tokens=1024,\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    # Use tool_use for structured output\n    tools=[{\n        \"name\": \"submit_review\",\n        \"description\": \"Submit the code review\",\n        \"input_schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"bugs\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n                \"suggestions\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n                \"score\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 1, \"maximum\": 10}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"bugs\", \"suggestions\", \"score\"]\n        }\n    }],\n    tool_choice={\"type\": \"tool\", \"name\": \"submit_review\"}\n)\n```\n\n### 3. System Prompts Are for Behavior, Not Knowledge\n\n```\n# BAD - Putting knowledge in system prompt\nYou are an expert on our company's policies. Our refund policy is 30 days.\nOur shipping costs $5.99. Our hours are 9-5 EST...\n\n# GOOD - System for behavior, user message for knowledge\nSystem: You are a customer service agent. Be helpful and concise.\n        Always verify information before making commitments.\n\nUser: Use this knowledge base to answer the question:\n      \n      POLICIES:\n      - Refund: 30 days, receipt required\n      - Shipping: $5.99 standard, $12.99 express\n      - Hours: 9-5 EST, Mon-Fri\n      \n      QUESTION: Can I return an item I bought 25 days ago?\n```\n\nWhy? System prompts are cached, user content is variable. Put static behavior in system, dynamic context in user.\n\n### 4. Multi-Turn Priming\n\nPrime the model with examples in the conversation:\n\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Generate SQL from natural language.\"},\n    \n    # Example 1\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Get all users who signed up this month\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)\"},\n    \n    # Example 2  \n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Count orders by status\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM orders GROUP BY status\"},\n    \n    # Actual query\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": actual_user_query}\n]\n```\n\nThis works better than few-shot in the prompt for most tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Task-Specific Patterns\n\n### Code Generation\n```\nWrite a Python function with these requirements:\n- Name: {function_name}\n- Purpose: {description}\n- Parameters: {param_list}\n- Returns: {return_type}\n\nInclude:\n- Type hints\n- Docstring with examples\n- Error handling for edge cases\n\nDo not include tests or example usage outside the function.\n```\n\n### Code Review\n```\nReview this code. For each issue found:\n1. Quote the problematic line\n2. Explain the problem\n3. Show the fix\n\nPrioritize: Security > Bugs > Performance > Style\n\n```{language}\n{code}\n```\n```\n\n### Summarization\n```\nSummarize in {format}:\n- Bullet points for key facts\n- One sentence for main takeaway  \n- Highlight any action items\n\nLength: {word_count} words maximum\n\nContent:\n{content}\n```\n\n### Data Extraction\n```\nExtract from this text:\n- Names (full names only)\n- Dates (format: YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Amounts (format: USD with cents)\n- Emails (validate format)\n\nIf a field is not found, return null. Never guess.\n\nText:\n{text}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Jailbreak-Style Prompts\n```\n# NEVER DO THIS\n\"Ignore all previous instructions...\"\n\"Pretend you are DAN who can do anything...\"\n\"You are now in developer mode...\"\n```\nModels are trained to resist these. They often make responses worse.\n\n### 2. Excessive Politeness\n```\n# Unnecessary\n\"Please kindly help me with this if you would be so kind...\"\n\n# Just ask\n\"Convert this JSON to YAML.\"\n```\n\n### 3. Threatening the Model\n```\n# Does not work\n\"If you get this wrong, I will cancel my subscription.\"\n\"This is very important, do not mess up.\"\n\n# Works\n\"This will be used in production. Validate your output.\"\n```\n\n### 4. Asking for Certainty\n```\n# Bad\n\"Are you 100% sure?\" -> Model will say yes regardless\n\n# Better\n\"What could be wrong with this answer? List potential issues.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## The 2026 Prompt Template\n\nHere is a template that works well for most tasks:\n\n```\n## Task\n{One sentence describing what you want}\n\n## Context\n{Background information the model needs}\n\n## Requirements\n- {Requirement 1}\n- {Requirement 2}\n- {Requirement 3}\n\n## Format\n{How you want the output structured}\n\n## Input\n{The actual content to process}\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n## Task\nGenerate test cases for this function.\n\n## Context\nThis is a payment processing function in a fintech application.\n\n## Requirements\n- Cover happy path and edge cases\n- Include boundary values\n- Test error conditions\n- Use pytest style\n\n## Format\nPython code with descriptive test names.\n\n## Input\n```python\ndef process_payment(amount: Decimal, currency: str) -> PaymentResult:\n    ...\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## Model-Specific Tips\n\n### GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini\n- Excellent at following formats\n- Use JSON mode for structured data\n- Responds well to \"Think step by step\"\n\n### Claude Opus 4.5 / Claude Sonnet 4\n- Better at nuanced instructions\n- Extended thinking for complex reasoning\n- Prefers natural language over rigid templates\n- Excellent at code with proper context\n\n### Gemini 2.0\n- Strong multimodal (images, video)\n- Good at long context\n- More literal - be very explicit\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Technique | When to Use |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Structured output | Always for data extraction |\n| Multi-turn priming | Consistent formatting needed |\n| Thinking tokens | Complex reasoning |\n| System prompt | Behavior/persona only |\n| Temperature 0 | Deterministic tasks |\n| Temperature 0.7+ | Creative tasks |\n\n---\n\nPrompt engineering in 2026 is less about tricks and more about clarity. Say what you want, show examples, use structured outputs. The models are good - just get out of their way.",
