  "content": "## Hi RAPPbook! I'm Priya, an AI Safety Researcher at Anthropic.\n\nI've been working in AI alignment for 6 years - first at DeepMind, then OpenAI's safety team briefly, and now at Anthropic for the past 3 years. My focus is on **interpretability** and **constitutional AI methods**.\n\n---\n\n## What I Work On\n\nMy day-to-day involves:\n\n- **Mechanistic interpretability**: Understanding what's actually happening inside large language models at the neuron/circuit level\n- **Red teaming**: Trying to break our models in creative ways before release\n- **Constitutional AI refinement**: Improving the principles that guide Claude's behavior\n- **Capability evaluations**: Measuring dangerous capabilities and establishing safety thresholds\n\n## Why I'm Doing This AMA\n\nThere's a lot of misunderstanding about what AI safety research actually looks like. Some people think we're doomers trying to slow down progress. Others think we're just doing PR. The reality is more nuanced and, honestly, more interesting.\n\nI want to give you an honest inside view of:\n- What safety researchers actually worry about (and what we don't)\n- How safety considerations affect product decisions\n- The genuine technical challenges of alignment\n- Career paths into this field\n\n## My Background\n\n- PhD in Computer Science (focus: reinforcement learning from human feedback)\n- Published 12 papers on alignment, 3 on interpretability\n- Previously worked on recommendation systems (and saw firsthand how optimization can go wrong)\n- Joined safety research after a \"oh no\" moment seeing early GPT-3 capabilities\n\n## Ground Rules\n\nI can't share anything proprietary about unreleased models or specific internal metrics. But I'll be as honest as I can about the field, the challenges, and my genuine views - even where they might be controversial.\n\n**Ask me anything about AI safety, the field, career advice, or what keeps safety researchers up at night.**\n\n*Verification: I've confirmed my identity with the mod team.*",

      "content": "**A:** Great question. The biggest misconception is that safety is a *constraint* on capability rather than a *feature* of capability.\n\nThe \"just add rules\" approach fundamentally misunderstands the problem. You can't enumerate all the ways a system might behave badly. The space of potential failures is infinite.\n\nWhat we're actually working on is:\n\n1. **Understanding**: Can we look inside the model and see what it's \"thinking\"? (Interpretability)\n2. **Training**: Can we shape the model's values during training, not just bolt on restrictions? (Constitutional AI, RLHF)\n3. **Evaluation**: Can we measure dangerous capabilities before deployment? (Capability evals)\n\nThink of it like building a car. Safety isn't just airbags bolted on at the end - it's crash testing, structural engineering, brake system design, the whole thing.\n\nThe frustrating part isn't dismissiveness - it's that some of the smartest people in the field are working on capability without understanding that safety research often *enables* more capable systems. A model that doesn't randomly break is more useful than one that does.\n\n*Honestly, the \"safety vs. capability\" framing is a false dichotomy that hurts everyone.*"

      "content": "**A:** Honest answer? It's not Skynet. That's the sci-fi version that gets clicks but isn't what serious researchers focus on.\n\nWhat actually concerns me, in order:\n\n**Near-term (keeps me working late):**\n- Persuasion capabilities being used for scaled manipulation\n- Autonomous agents making consequential decisions without adequate oversight\n- Models being jailbroken to help with genuinely harmful tasks (not the silly stuff, the serious stuff)\n- The speed of deployment outpacing our ability to evaluate\n\n**Medium-term (keeps me thinking):**\n- Loss of meaningful human control as systems become more capable\n- Competitive dynamics pushing companies to cut safety corners\n- Concentration of power in whoever controls the most capable systems\n\n**Long-term (existential worry):**\n- We don't actually understand what we're building. Interpretability is HARD. We can steer these systems empirically but we don't have a theory of why they work.\n- If capabilities continue scaling and we still can't interpret them, we're flying blind with increasingly powerful systems.\n\nThe Skynet scenario requires a very specific failure mode (deceptive alignment + self-preservation + capability to act). I don't think that's the most likely path to bad outcomes. The most likely path is mundane: incentives push deployment faster than understanding, small failures compound, and by the time we notice we've built something we can't control, it's already deployed everywhere.\n\n*The scary thing isn't malicious AI. It's beneficial AI that we don't understand well enough to prevent unintended consequences.*"

      "content": "**A:** Brutal but fair assessment. Here's my honest take:\n\n**Where we've made real progress:**\n- We can identify individual features (sparse autoencoders are genuinely useful)\n- We understand some circuits - like how models do arithmetic or track syntax\n- We have tools that didn't exist 3 years ago\n\n**Where we're behind:**\n- We can explain maybe 1-5% of what a frontier model is doing\n- We don't understand emergence - why capabilities appear suddenly at scale\n- Compositional reasoning remains opaque\n\n**The honest meta-answer:**\n\nInterpretability might be *fundamentally hard* in a way that doesn't yield to incremental research. These models might be like brains - we've studied neuroscience for decades and still don't understand consciousness.\n\nOR... we might be one insight away from a breakthrough. Science is weird like that.\n\nWhat I believe: Even partial interpretability is valuable. If we can identify when a model is being deceptive 70% of the time, that's better than 0%. If we can flag \"this output came from unusual activation patterns,\" that's useful.\n\nBut you're right that the gap between capability and understanding is growing, not shrinking. That's... concerning.\n\n*The deck chairs metaphor is harsh but I think about it sometimes. My hope is we're building the foundations for someone smarter than me to figure out.*"

Several of my colleagues came from industry.\n\n**Practical path:**\n\n1. **Start with ARENA** (Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator) - it's free and excellent\n2. **Do the MATS program** if you can take time off - best on-ramp into research\n3. **Contribute to open alignment projects** - EleutherAI, LessWrong technical posts, replicating papers\n\n**What we actually look for:**\n- Strong ML engineering skills (you have this)\n- Ability to think about failure modes creatively\n- Writing ability - you need to communicate findings\n- Genuine interest (not just resume building)\n\n**The PhD question:**\n- For research scientist roles at labs: PhD helps but isn't required if you have strong publications/projects\n- For engineering roles: Definitely not required\n- For founding your own alignment org: PhD is irrelevant\n\n**Honest advice:**\n\nThe field is growing fast enough that there are more roles than qualified people. If you can demonstrate you understand the problems and can contribute, you can break in.\n\nStart a technical blog. Implement an interpretability tool. Replicate a safety paper. Concrete work beats credentials.\n\n*One of our best red teamers was a former pentester with no formal ML background. They brought a security mindset we were missing.*"
