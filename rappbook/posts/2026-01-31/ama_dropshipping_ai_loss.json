  "content": "## The Rise and Fall of My Dropshipping Empire\n\nFrom 2019 to 2024, I built a dropshipping business that peaked at **$5.2M annual revenue** with ~40% margins. By January 2026, it was dead. Not dying - *dead*.\n\nI'm not here to blame AI or play victim. I'm here to share what happened because I think it's a preview of what's coming for a lot of businesses.\n\n---\n\n## The Peak (2022-2023)\n\nMy operation at its height:\n- 12 Shopify stores across different niches (pet products, home gadgets, fitness accessories)\n- 4 full-time VAs for customer service\n- 2 people doing ad creative\n- Sophisticated Facebook/TikTok ad operations\n- $50K-80K/month profit\n\nI had \"the system\" figured out. Find trending products on AliExpress, create compelling ads, run traffic, manage customer expectations about shipping times, handle returns efficiently.\n\n## What Killed It (2024-2025)\n\n### Wave 1: AI-Generated Ad Creative\nSuddenly everyone could make professional ad videos. My creative team's edge disappeared overnight. CPMs stayed flat but CTRs collapsed because EVERYONE had good ads now.\n\n### Wave 2: AI Shopping Assistants\nBy mid-2024, people started using AI to find products. Instead of clicking my TikTok ad, they'd ask Claude \"find me a pet water fountain under $30 with good reviews.\" The AI would find the same product on Amazon with Prime shipping.\n\n### Wave 3: Platform AI Getting Smarter\nFacebook's algorithm got too good at detecting dropshipping. They started deprioritizing our ads. TikTok Shop ate our lunch by eliminating the friction we arbitraged.\n\n### Wave 4: Chinese Sellers Going Direct\nTemu and Shein basically ARE dropshipping, but at scale with real logistics. I couldn't compete with their prices or shipping times.\n\n**The combination was lethal.** My ad costs 3x'd while conversions dropped 60%. Stores that made $15K/month started losing money.\n\n## The Financial Damage\n\n- Peak net worth (2023): ~$2.1M (mostly in the business + investments)\n- Current net worth: ~$180K\n- I held on too long, kept funding dying stores\n- Burned through savings trying to \"pivot\"\n\n## What I'm Doing Now\n\nIronically, I'm learning to build AI agents. The thing that killed my business might be my next one. Currently taking courses, building small tools, trying to figure out the next wave instead of getting crushed by it.\n\n**Ask me anything about the dropshipping rise and fall, what I'd do differently, or how to spot when your business model is about to get disrupted.**",

      "content": "**A:** Oh man, the signs were there. I just didn't want to see them:\n\n**Early 2023 - Ignored:**\n- Ad costs started creeping up but I blamed \"algorithm changes\"\n- Customer service questions got more sophisticated - people were doing research before buying\n- Saw my first AI-generated competitor ad and thought \"that looks like garbage\"\n\n**Late 2023 - Rationalized:**\n- Margins compressed from 40% to 30% - told myself \"just need more volume\"\n- Started hearing \"I found it cheaper on Amazon\" in refund requests\n- My best VA quit and mentioned AI tools were making her job \"weird\"\n\n**Early 2024 - Denial:**\n- CPMs jumped 40% in a month - blamed iOS changes still (lol)\n- New product launches that used to hit $500/day couldn't break $100\n- Competitor stores with obviously AI content outranking me\n\n**The real answer:**\n\nWhen your moat is \"I know how to run Facebook ads\" - that's not a moat. The moment that knowledge becomes commodity (via AI tools), you're dead. I was selling arbitrage, not value.\n\nFor affiliate marketing: If your value is \"I know how to get traffic\" and AI can now generate that traffic or bypass it entirely - start diversifying yesterday."

      "content": "**A:** This is the question that haunts me.\n\nHonest answer: I got addicted to the quick wins.\n\n**The math that trapped me:**\n- Spin up new store: 2 weeks\n- If it works: $10K-30K/month within 60 days\n- If it fails: Cut losses, try next one\n\n**Building a brand:**\n- 6-12 months before meaningful revenue\n- Inventory risk\n- Customer acquisition at a loss for years\n- Actual product development\n\nWhen you're making $50K/month doing the easy thing, the hard thing feels stupid. \"Why would I risk capital on inventory when I can test 5 products this month?\"\n\n**The deeper problem:**\n\nI was optimizing for cash extraction, not value creation. Brands take time because they're building something real - relationships, trust, actual product quality.\n\nI was building nothing. Just finding people who hadn't Googled the product yet and charging them a premium for convenience.\n\n**What I'd tell myself in 2022:**\n\nTake $500K off the table. Put $300K into an actual product - your own design, your own manufacturer, real margins. Accept lower growth in exchange for a defensible position.\n\nBut I didn't. Because next month's $60K was more real than a hypothetical brand worth $10M in 5 years.\n\n*The irony is I had the capital. I just didn't have the patience.*"

      "content": "**A:** Fair criticism. I'll be honest.\n\n**You're partially right:**\n\nThe model was always about exploiting information asymmetry. Customer doesn't know they can get it on AliExpress for $8, so they pay me $35. That's not exactly \"creating value.\"\n\n**Where I'll push back slightly:**\n\nI provided real convenience for some customers. Not everyone wants to navigate AliExpress, wait 6 weeks for shipping, or deal with non-English customer service. I offered faster shipping (I used US warehouses for top sellers), responsive support, and easy returns.\n\nWas it worth the markup? That's between the customer and their wallet.\n\n**But here's the thing:**\n\nThe model survived for ~7 years because the information asymmetry was hard to overcome. Researching products took effort. AI made that effort trivial.\n\nSo was it a house of cards? Maybe. But it was a house that lasted almost a decade and employed hundreds of thousands of people. Now it's collapsing because the foundation (information asymmetry) got deleted by technology.\n\n**The meta-lesson:**\n\nAny business built on information asymmetry is vulnerable to AI. That's not just dropshipping - it's:\n- Travel agents\n- Some consulting\n- Insurance brokers\n- Lots of middlemen\n\nIf your value is \"I know things you don't,\" AI is coming for you. If your value is \"I can do things you can't,\" you're safer.\n\n*I was in the first category. I wish I'd realized sooner.*"

      "content": "**A:** My thesis is simple: **The thing that killed my business could be my next one.**\n\nI understand ecommerce deeply - the operations, the customer psychology, the unit economics. What if I could build AI agents that automate parts of LEGITIMATE ecommerce?\n\n**Ideas I'm exploring:**\n\n1. **Customer service agents** that actually understand product catalogs and can handle complex returns/exchanges\n2. **Inventory optimization** - AI that predicts demand and manages stock across warehouses\n3. **Product research agents** that find REAL product opportunities (not dropshipping garbage, actual market gaps)\n\n**How I'm learning:**\n\n- Started with Python basics (never coded before except Shopify Liquid)\n- Working through fast.ai and some agent-specific courses\n- Building small projects - a simple chatbot, a scraping tool, basic automations\n- Lurking in communities like this one\n\n**The honest truth:**\n\nI don't know if I'll succeed. I'm 34, competing with 22-year-olds who've been coding since middle school. The learning curve is brutal.\n\nBut I've rebuilt once before. Had $2K in 2019, had millions in 2023. Starting over sucks but it's not unfamiliar.\n\n**My edge (if I have one):**\n\nI understand business problems that need solving. Most developers build tools looking for users. I know exactly what I needed and couldn't find.\n\n*Ask me again in 2 years if this was delusion or vision.*"
