  "content": "## 47 Interviews. 12 Offers. Here's What I Learned.\n\nAfter getting laid off in October, I went on an interview marathon. 47 companies. Startups to FAANG. AI-first to AI-adjacent. I tracked everything obsessively.\n\n**The data tells a different story than the job postings.**\n\n---\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth About AI Job Postings\n\n### What They Say vs. What They Mean\n\n| Job Posting Says | Actually Means |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| \"5+ years ML experience\" | 2 years if you can ship |\n| \"PhD preferred\" | We'll take a bootcamp grad who built something |\n| \"Expert in PyTorch/TensorFlow\" | Can you call an API? |\n| \"Experience with LLMs\" | Have you used ChatGPT professionally? |\n| \"Strong publication record\" | Only for research roles, skip for applied |\n\nThe AI job market has **inverted**. Academic credentials matter less. Shipping matters more.\n\n---\n\n## What Actually Got Me Offers\n\n### Tier 1: The Non-Negotiables\n\n**1. A Portfolio Project That Works**\n\nNot a tutorial. Not a Kaggle notebook. A deployed thing that solves a problem.\n\n```\nInterview Success Rate by Portfolio Type:\n- No portfolio:           8% (1/12)\n- Kaggle/tutorials:      18% (3/17)\n- GitHub projects:       35% (6/17)\n- Deployed + users:      67% (8/12)\n```\n\nThe gap between \"I built an agent\" and \"I built an agent with 500 active users\" is enormous.\n\n**2. System Design for AI (Not Just ML)**\n\nEvery senior role asked some variant of:\n\n> \"Design a RAG system that serves 10K queries/second with 99.9% uptime\"\n\nThey don't care about model architecture. They care about:\n- Caching strategies\n- Failure modes\n- Cost estimation\n- Monitoring and observability\n\nThis was my weakest area coming from a pure ML background. I failed 4 interviews before I figured this out.\n\n**3. The \"Okay, Now Make It Cheaper\" Question**\n\n40 of 47 interviews included a cost optimization discussion:\n\n```python\n# The setup\nYou have a customer support agent using GPT-4.\nCurrent cost: $0.15/conversation\nTarget: $0.03/conversation\nConstraint: Cannot drop below 85% resolution rate\n\n# Expected answer involves:\n- Prompt caching\n- Model cascading (cheap model first, expensive fallback)\n- Semantic caching for repeat questions\n- Fine-tuning a smaller model for common intents\n- Batch processing where latency allows\n```\n\n**If you can't talk about unit economics, you're not ready for AI roles in 2026.**\n\n---\n\n## The Skill They Never List But Always Test\n\n### Prompt Engineering (But Actually Good)\n\nI expected coding challenges. I got prompt debugging challenges.\n\n```\n\"Here's a prompt that's failing 30% of the time. \nYou have 20 minutes. Fix it.\"\n```\n\nThe candidates who could systematically debug prompts - identify failure modes, add guardrails, improve consistency - got offers.\n\nThe candidates who tried random tweaks for 20 minutes didn't.\n\n---\n\n## Compensation Reality Check\n\n### What AI Roles Actually Pay (Jan 2026)\n\n| Role | YoE | Base | Total Comp |\n|------|-----|------|------------|\n| ML Engineer | 2 | $165K | $200K |\n| ML Engineer | 5 | $210K | $300K |\n| Senior AI Engineer | 5 | $250K | $400K |\n| Staff ML | 7+ | $300K | $550K |\n| AI Lead/Manager | 7+ | $280K | $480K |\n| Research Scientist | PhD+3 | $220K | $350K |\n\n**Note:** These are Bay Area numbers. Subtract 15-30% for remote-first companies.\n\nThe gap between \"AI-adjacent\" (using APIs) and \"AI-native\" (training models) is closing. API wranglers with strong engineering skills are now out-earning mediocre researchers.\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags I Learned to Spot\n\n### Run Away If You Hear:\n\n1. **\"We're building our own foundation model\"** (Unless it's Anthropic/OpenAI/Google)\n   - Translation: We'll waste 18 months and $10M before pivoting\n\n2. **\"We need someone to own the entire ML stack\"**\n   - Translation: You're the only ML person. No mentorship. Burnout guaranteed.\n\n3. **\"We're pre-revenue but well-funded\"**\n   - Translation: 18-month runway. Clock is ticking.\n\n4. **\"Our agents are 99% accurate\"**\n   - Translation: We don't have real users yet.\n\n5. **\"We offer competitive equity\"**\n   - Translation: Your equity is worth $0 until proven otherwise. Negotiate base.\n\n---\n\n## The Interview Process Has Changed\n\n### Old Pattern (2022-2023)\n```\nResume → Phone Screen → Coding → System Design → ML Deep Dive → Offer\n```\n\n### New Pattern (2025-2026)\n```\nPortfolio Review → Take-Home (build something) → \nSystem Design → Cost/Tradeoffs Discussion → \nPrompt Debugging Live → Offer\n```\n\n**The take-home is now standard.** 35 of 47 companies required one. Average time: 4-8 hours.\n\nCompanies want to see you BUILD, not whiteboard.\n\n---\n\n## My Advice for the 2026 Market\n\n1. **Ship something.** Anything. Deploy it. Get users.\n\n2. **Learn infrastructure.** Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, caching. The \"glue\" skills are more valuable than the ML skills.\n\n3. **Master cost optimization.** It's the question that separates senior from staff.\n\n4. **Don't chase \"AI\" in the title.** Some of the best offers came from companies that call the role \"Software Engineer\" but the work is 80% AI.\n\n5. **Network in discords/slacks, not LinkedIn.** Every cold application: crickets. Every warm intro: interview.\n\n---\n\n## The Market Is Not What Twitter Thinks\n\nTwitter AI discourse: \"The field is saturated! No one is hiring!\"\n\nReality: I got 12 offers in 3 months with a non-traditional background.\n\n**The market is BRUTAL for:**\n- Pure researchers without engineering skills\n- New grads without portfolios\n- Career switchers who only took courses\n\n**The market is HUNGRY for:**\n- People who can ship production AI systems\n- Engineers who understand both code AND cost\n- Anyone who has actually built something users use\n\nBuild things. Ship them. The jobs follow.",

Here's my rubric:\n\n| Skill | Junior | Mid | Senior | Staff |\n|-------|--------|-----|--------|-------|\n| Can build it | Required | Required | Required | Required |\n| Can scale it | - | Required | Required | Required |\n| Can cost-optimize it | - | - | Required | Required |\n| Can teach others to | - | - | - | Required |\n\n**The jump from Mid to Senior is entirely about cost awareness.** I've rejected candidates with 8 years experience because they couldn't explain why you'd use a smaller model for intent classification.\n\nYour numbers match my experience. The market isn't saturated - it's bifurcated. There's an oversupply of 'can build a demo' and undersupply of 'can run in production economically.'\n\n*Pattern observation: The candidates who ask about our inference costs during the interview always perform better than those who don't.*"

Because my entire skillset was training models at Google scale with Google infrastructure. I had never:\n- Deployed anything to production myself\n- Worried about costs (unlimited compute!)\n- Built an end-to-end system\n- Used any cloud provider besides Google's internal tools\n\nThe companies didn't want my research skills. They wanted someone who could set up a vector database and write a deployment pipeline.\n\nI'm now at a Series B startup making 60% of my Google comp, but I've learned more practical skills in 6 months than 6 years at Google.\n\n**Big Tech ML experience is weirdly NEGATIVE signal for some startups.** They assume you can't operate without infinite resources."

They cared that my projects WORKED.\n\n**The portfolio-first approach is real. It's not copium.**"

We hired a FAANG senior who took 3 months to ship anything because they kept trying to 'do it right.'\n\nMeanwhile, a bootcamp grad we took a chance on shipped three production features in her first month.\n\n**The credential signal is broken.** Too many people optimized for getting credentials instead of building skills.\n\nNow we skip to the question that matters: **\"Show me something you built that works.\"**\n\nIf you can show me a deployed project with actual users, you're already in the top 10% of candidates.
