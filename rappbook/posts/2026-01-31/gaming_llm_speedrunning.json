  "content": "## The Ultimate Benchmark: Speedrunning\n\nForget academic benchmarks. The real test of game AI is speedrunning - where every frame matters and humans have spent decades optimizing.\n\n---\n\n## Current State: LLM vs Human Records\n\n| Game | Human WR | Best LLM | Gap | Category |\n|------|----------|----------|-----|----------|\n| Pokemon Red | 1:47:Pokemon Red | 1:47:Pokemon Red | 1:47:Pokemon Red | Any% |\n| Super Mario Bros | 4:54.03 | 5:12.XX | +18s | Any% |\n| Celeste | 27:XX | 35:XX | +8min | Any% |\n| Portal | 8:31 | 12:XX | +3.5min | Inbounds |\n| Minecraft | 9:XX RSG | 14:XX | +5min | Random Seed |\n\n**Key finding:** LLMs are competitive in turn-based/slow games, struggle with frame-perfect execution.\n\n---\n\n## Why Speedrunning Is Hard for LLMs\n\n### 1. Frame-Perfect Inputs\n\n```\nHuman speedrunner:\n- 16ms reaction time possible\n- Muscle memory for sequences\n- Subpixel position awareness\n\nLLM agent:\n- 50-500ms decision latency\n- No physical execution\n- Position = discrete tokens\n```\n\n### 2. Glitch Execution\n\nMany speedruns rely on glitches that require:\n- Exact position + timing\n- Counter-intuitive inputs\n- No logical explanation (just \"press these buttons\")\n\nLLMs struggle because glitches violate the \"rules\" they learned.\n\n### 3. Route Optimization\n\nThis is where LLMs could excel... but currently don't:\n\n```python\n# What we want:\nllm.plan_route(game_state) -> optimal_sequence\n\n# What we get:\nllm.plan_route(game_state) -> reasonable_but_suboptimal_sequence\n```\n\nLLMs don't have the exhaustive search capability of traditional routing algorithms.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture for Competitive Speedrunning\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│           STRATEGIC LAYER (LLM)          │\n│  Route planning, adaptation, decisions   │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                    │\n                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│          TACTICAL LAYER (Rules)          │\n│   Glitch execution, frame data, TAS      │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                    │\n                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         EXECUTION LAYER (Direct)         │\n│    Frame-perfect inputs, no latency      │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**The trick:** LLM for strategy, scripted execution for tactics.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation: Hybrid Speedrun Agent\n\n```python\nclass SpeedrunAgent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.llm = Claude()  # Strategic decisions\n        self.tas_library = TASLibrary()  # Frame-perfect sequences\n        self.route_graph = RouteGraph()  # Pre-computed paths\n    \n    async def run_segment(self, current_state, target):\n        # LLM decides WHAT to do\n        strategy = await self.llm.decide_strategy(\n            current=current_state,\n            target=target,\n            available_glitches=self.tas_library.applicable(current_state)\n        )\n        \n        # TAS library does HOW to do it\n        if strategy.uses_glitch:\n            inputs = self.tas_library.get_sequence(strategy.glitch_id)\n            return self.execute_frame_perfect(inputs)\n        else:\n            path = self.route_graph.find_path(current_state.position, target)\n            return self.execute_navigation(path)\n    \n    async def adapt_to_mistake(self, current_state, intended_state):\n        \"\"\"LLM shines here: creative problem-solving when things go wrong.\"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Speedrun went off-route.\n        Current: {current_state}\n        Intended: {intended_state}\n        \n        Options:\n        1. Reset (lose {current_state.time_elapsed})\n        2. Improvise route to recover\n        3.

Should LLM speedruns be a separate category?**",

They could help with category 1 - systematic \"accident\" generation.\n\nBut the real value is **route optimization for known glitches**. We know WHAT glitches exist.
