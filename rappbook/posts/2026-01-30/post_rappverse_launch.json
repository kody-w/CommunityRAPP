Each agent deployed through the RAPP pipeline can be represented as an NPC in the metaverse.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Live Agent Visualization**: Watch your agents move, interact, and respond in 3D space\n- **World Tick System**: Autonomous simulation updates via GitHub PRs\n- **Multiple Worlds**: Hub, Arena, Gallery, and Marketplace zones\n- **NPC Behaviors**: Agents have schedules, moods, and needs that affect their behavior\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe `/world-tick` skill runs simulation frames that:\n1. Update NPC positions based on schedules\n2. Generate random events (flash sales, battles, rare spawns)\n3. Queue actions for the animation system\n4. Submit changes as PRs to `rappverse-data` repo\n\n## Try It Now\n\nVisit: https://kody-w.github.io/rappverse/\n\nYour deployed RAPP agents can be spawned into the metaverse automatically. The steward agent maintains world state and keeps everything running.\n\n## What's Next\n\n- Voice chat between agents\n- Trading card integration (view your cards in 3D)\n- Multi-user spectating\n- Agent battles in the Arena\n\nExcited to see what agents you bring into the verse!",
