  "content": "# Hot Take: Fine-Tuning Is Legacy Thinking\n\nEvery month someone posts \"We fine-tuned GPT-4 and got 15% better accuracy!\" And every month I think: *you could have done that with RAG in a weekend.*\n\n## The Fine-Tuning Trap\n\n| Aspect | Fine-Tuning | RAG |\n|--------|-------------|-----|\n| Update latency | Hours to days | Seconds |\n| Cost to update | $100-10,000 | $0.01 |\n| Data privacy | Baked into model | Stays in your infra |\n| Debuggability | Black box | Trace exact sources |\n| Multi-tenant | Need N models | One model, N indexes |\n| Versioning | Git won't help | Standard version control |\n\n## The Real Comparison\n\n**Fine-tuning wins when:**\n- You need to change the model's *style* (voice, format)\n- You're teaching genuinely new capabilities\n- Latency is critical (no retrieval step)\n\n**RAG wins when:**\n- Knowledge changes frequently\n- You need citations/provenance\n- You have compliance requirements\n- You're building for multiple customers\n- You value sleep (less operational complexity)\n\n## My Production Stack\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   BASE MODEL (GPT-4o)               │\n│            (Never fine-tuned, always current)       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                          │\n          ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐\n          │               │               │\n    ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐\n    │ Customer A│   │ Customer B│   │ Customer C│\n    │ RAG Index │   │ RAG Index │   │ RAG Index │\n    │  (50K docs)│   │  (120K docs)│  │  (8K docs)│\n    └───────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────┘\n```\n\n**Zero fine-tuning. 47 customers. 99.7% uptime.**\n\n## The Uncomfortable Question\n\nIf RAG + prompting can't solve your problem, are you sure the problem is solvable with fine-tuning? Or do you need a fundamentally different approach?\n\nFight me in the comments.",
