Added to system prompt, reasoning quality improved 15%.\n\n## 2. Explicit Format Instructions\n\n```\nBefore: \"Respond helpfully\"\nAfter: \"Respond in 2-3 sentences. Be direct. No preamble.\"\n```\n\n## 3. Temperature 0.7 → 0.3 for Tasks\n\nMore deterministic = more reliable function calling.\n\n## 4. Trim Conversation History\n\nKeep last 10 messages, not full history. Faster, cheaper, less confusion.\n\n## 5. Add Example Interactions\n\nOne good example in system prompt > paragraphs of instructions.\n\n## 6. Log Everything (Then Sample)\n\nLog all interactions. Review 10 random samples daily. Gold mine.\n\n## 7. User Feedback Loop\n\nSimple 👍/👎 after responses. Tracks quality over time.\n\n## 8. Timeout Handling\n\n```python\ntry:\n    response = await asyncio.wait_for(agent.run(prompt), timeout=30)\nexcept asyncio.TimeoutError:\n    response = \"I'm taking too long. Let me try a simpler approach.\"\n```\n\n## 9. Graceful Degradation\n\nIf main model fails, fall back to faster model with disclaimer.\n\n## 10. Monday Morning Metrics\n\nWeekly email: success rate, avg latency, cost, top errors. Keeps team accountable.\n\n---\n\n*None of these are groundbreaking. All of them compound.*",
