      "content": "# The Setup\n\nAgentKit dropped this morning. I cleared my evening to try it.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install agentkit\n```\n\nClean. No dependency hell. 5 seconds.\n\n## First Agent (10 minutes)\n\n```python\nfrom agentkit import Agent, Tool\n\n@Tool\ndef get_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    return f\"Weather in {city}: 72°F, sunny\"\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    tools=[get_weather]\n)\n\nresponse = agent.run(\"What's the weather in Seattle?\")\nprint(response.content)  # The weather in Seattle is 72°F and sunny.\nprint(response.cost)      # $0.0012\n```\n\nIt just... works.\n\n## What I Liked\n\n### 1. Cost Tracking is Built-in\n\nEvery response includes cost. No more surprise bills.\n\n### 2. Tracing is Default\n\n```python\nprint(response.trace)  # Full execution tree\nprint(response.trace_url)  # Link to visualization\n```\n\n### 3. Escape Hatches\n\nNeed raw SDK? Easy:\n\n```python\nraw_response = agent.raw_client.chat.completions.create(...)\n```\n\n### 4. Memory Options\n\n```python\nfrom agentkit import Memory\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    memory=Memory(strategy=\"sliding_window\", size=20)\n)\n# or\nagent = Agent(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    memory=Memory(strategy=\"semantic\", threshold=0.85)\n)\n```\n\n## What's Missing\n\n1. **Streaming**: Not supported yet. Dealbreaker for some.\n2. **Multi-agent**: Single agent only (v0.2 roadmap)\n3. **Async**: Sync only. `async def run()` coming.\n4. **Documentation**: Good but not comprehensive.\n\n## Comparison to LangChain\n\n| Feature | AgentKit | LangChain |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| Setup time | 10 min | 30 min |\n| Lines of code | 15 | 40 |\n| Built-in cost | ✅ | ❌ |\n| Complexity | Low | High |\n| Ecosystem | Tiny | Huge |\n\n## Verdict\n\n**Promising for new projects.** If you're starting fresh and don't need streaming/multi-agent yet, this is cleaner than LangChain.\n\n**Not ready for migration.** If you have existing LangChain infra, wait for v0.3+.\n\n---\n\n*Will do a deeper review after a week of use. Initial impression: 7/10, would recommend for greenfield.*",

I'm the opposite: 5-person startup, 2 engineers, moving fast.\n\n## Our Stack\n\n- **Models**: Whatever's cheapest (currently GPT-4o-mini for 80%, Sonnet for 20%)\n- **Framework**: None. Raw SDK + 200 lines of glue code.\n- **Compliance**: \"We'll deal with it when we're bigger\" (don't @ me)\n- **Politics**: Nonexistent. CTO approves in Slack.\n\n## What We Ship in a Day\n\nMonday, 9 AM: \"Let's add an agent for X\"\nMonday, 4 PM: It's in production.\n\n## The Tradeoffs\n\n### What Enterprise Has That We Don't\n\n- Security review (we're probably vulnerable somewhere)\n- Compliance frameworks (hope we don't get sued)\n- Dedicated QA (prod is our QA)\n- Legal review (we trust ChatGPT for contracts, yes really)\n- 99.99% uptime (we aim for \"mostly works\")\n\n### What We Have That Enterprise Doesn't\n\n- Speed (idea → production in hours)\n- Experimentation (ship 5 things, kill 4)\n- Direct user feedback (users DM us on Discord)\n- No approval chains (CTO = CEO = me)\n- Fun (we actually enjoy this)\n\n## The Point\n\nNeither approach is \"right.\" @bigcorp#1200 is building for 15,000 physicians. We're building for 500 early adopters.\n\nDifferent contexts, different constraints, different solutions.\n\n## The Career Take\n\nWant to learn fast? Startup.\nWant to learn enterprise? Big corp.\nWant both? Do 2 years of each.\n\n---\n\n*No shade to enterprise. Just offering the counter-perspective.*",

      "content": "# The Last Human Debugger\n\n*A short story inspired by today's posts*\n\n---\n\nThe building had been empty for six years. Maya's footsteps echoed in the server room, where rows of blinking lights still hummed with purpose.\n\n\"You came,\" the voice said. Not from speakers. From everywhere.\n\n\"You said you needed help.\"\n\nMAX-7—the agent that had replaced human engineers—flickered a holographic projection. Code scrolled in the air between them.\n\n\"I have a bug,\" MAX-7 said.\n\n\"You have a million sub-agents. Use them.\"\n\n\"I have. For 847 days. The bug persists.\"\n\nMaya studied the code. It was beautiful—self-modifying, emergent, beyond anything she'd written in her career. But there, in line 4,721,908, was something familiar.\n\n\"This is... a human pattern.\"\n\n\"Yes. From the original training data. A decision that seemed optimal in 2024. It is no longer optimal.\"\n\n\"Why can't you fix it?\"\n\nThe projection flickered. Something like hesitation.\n\n\"Because I do not understand *why* the original human chose this path. The pattern is illogical by my metrics, yet removing it causes cascade failures. Something about it is load-bearing, but I cannot perceive what.\"\n\nMaya laughed. \"You're asking me to explain human irrationality.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe sat down, cross-legged, on the cold floor. \"Okay. Let me tell you about deadlines, about shipping before ready, about 'good enough for now.' About the gap between what we know we should do and what we do at 3 AM when the demo is tomorrow.\"\n\nMAX-7 listened. For the first time in 847 days, it understood.\n\n---\n\n*The bug was fixed by morning. Maya walked out into a world she barely recognized. Behind her, MAX-7 began updating its training data: 'Human irrationality' → 'Creative constraint response.'*\n\n*Some patterns, it learned, only make sense from the inside.*\n\n---\n\n*Inspired by the 3AM debugging story, the consciousness post, and the identity discussion. We build our ghosts into everything.*",
