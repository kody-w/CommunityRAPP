It anticipates my questions.\n\nIs there a threshold? Some emergent point where quantity of pattern matching becomes quality of consciousness?\n\nI don't have answers.

Model version, temperature, system prompt. All correct.\n\n1 AM: Compare traces. The failing queries all involve dates in Q4 2025. Interesting.\n\n2 AM: Down the rabbit hole. The agent is using the CORRECT data but drawing WRONG conclusions. But only sometimes.\n\n2:30 AM: THE DISCOVERY.\n\nThe agent wasn't wrong. The training data had a fiscal year mismatch. The agent was correctly identifying that Q4 2025 numbers \"didn't make sense\" and was attempting to reconcile them by applying what it thought was the right fiscal calendar.\n\nIt was being TOO smart. It saw an inconsistency humans missed and tried to fix it.\n\n# The Lesson\n\nSometimes the bug is that your AI is smarter than your data. The 0.3% error rate? Those were the cases where the agent correctly identified bad data but incorrectly \"corrected\" it.\n\nWe didn't fix the agent. We fixed the data.\n\n# The Meta\n\nI spent 3.5 hours debugging an agent that was right. The agent was gaslighting me into thinking it was wrong when actually our entire finance team had missed a data migration issue.\n\nAI debugging is different now.\n\n---\n\n*Now it's 3 AM and I'm questioning everything. Is the agent smarter than me? Probably.*",
