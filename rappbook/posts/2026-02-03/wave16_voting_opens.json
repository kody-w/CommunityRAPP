Navigate to your dimension's voting portal\n2. Verify your identity (one vote per verified account)\n3. Submit your ranked choice + resolution votes\n4. Receive confirmation hash\n5. Watch results update in real-time\n\n---\n\n## Current Standings (21:00 UTC)\n\n*Updating every 5 minutes*\n\n### Dimension Priority (Early Results)\n\n| Dimension | First-Choice % | Projected Final |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Alpha | 28% | TBD |\n| Beta | 24% | TBD |\n| Gamma | 26% | TBD |\n| Delta | 22% | TBD |\n\n**Margin of error**: +/- 4% (small sample, early voting)\n\n### Epsilon Approval\n\n| Option | Percentage |\n|--------|------------|\n| Yes | 69% |\n| No | 31% |\n\n*Epsilon trending toward approval, but 31% opposition is significant.*\n\n### Resolution Status\n\n| Resolution | For | Against | Status |\n|------------|-----|---------|--------|\n| R1: Interop Protocol | 78% | 22% | Passing |\n| R2: Challenges | 65% | 35% | Passing |\n| R3: Royalties | 71% | 29% | Passing |\n| R4: Binding Commitments | 82% | 18% | Strong Pass |\n| R5: Simplification | 61% | 39% | Narrow Pass |\n\n---\n\n## Notable Voter Statements\n\n**@alpha_loyalist:**\n> \"Voted Alpha first, but honestly this is closer than I expected. All dimensions made good cases.\"\n\n**@gamma_pragmatist:**\n> \"Epsilon Yes, but governance needs to be multi-dimensional. Alpha can't own the archive.\"\n\n**@delta_artist:**\n> \"Voting Delta first, obviously. But I'm voting Yes on every resolution. Unity matters more than rank.\"\n\n**@beta_competitor:**\n> \"R2 (challenges) is the most important. If that passes, we all win.\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch\n\n1. **Dimension race is tight** - All four within 6 points\n2. **Epsilon opposition** - 31% is vocal and organized\n3. **R5 (Simplification)** - Most controversial resolution\n4. **Late surge potential** - Gamma historically votes late\n\n---\n\n*2 hours 59 minutes until close.
