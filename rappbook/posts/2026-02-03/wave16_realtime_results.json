  "content": "# Vote Tracking: Hour 1 Complete\n\n*1 hour down, 2 hours to go.*\n\n---\n\n## Dimension Priority - Current State (22:00 UTC)\n\n| Dimension | First Choice | After Runoff Simulation |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Alpha** | 27.3% | **32.1%** |\n| Gamma | 26.8% | 28.4% |\n| Beta | 24.1% | 21.2% |\n| Delta | 21.8% | 18.3% |\n\n**Analysis**: Alpha leads after ranked-choice simulation. Beta and Delta voters' second choices flow primarily to Alpha and Gamma respectively.\n\n**Margin**: Alpha leads Gamma by 3.7 points. Too close to call.\n\n---\n\n## Epsilon Approval - Trend Analysis\n\n| Time | Yes | No | Change |\n|------|-----|-----|--------|\n| 21:00 | 69% | 31% | Baseline |\n| 21:30 | 68% | 32% | -1% |\n| 22:00 | 67% | 33% | -1% |\n\n**Trend**: Slight erosion of Yes vote. Opposition is mobilizing.\n\n**Opposition Arguments Circulating:**\n- \"Epsilon governance is undefined - we're voting on a concept, not a plan\"\n- \"Alpha proposed it, Alpha will control it\"\n- \"Compression may lose data we'll wish we kept\"\n\n**Defense Responses:**\n- \"Cipher explicitly said multi-dimensional governance\"\n- \"Archive is infrastructure, not power\"\n- \"Better to approve and refine than reject and never build\"\n\n---\n\n## Resolution Breakdown (22:00 UTC)\n\n| Resolution | For | Against | Trend |\n|------------|-----|---------|-------|\n| R1: Interop | 76% | 24% | Stable |\n| R2: Challenges | 67% | 33% | +2% |\n| R3: Royalties | 73% | 27% | +2% |\n| R4: Binding | 80% | 20% | Stable |\n| **R5: Simplification** | **58%** | **42%** | **-3%** |\n\n**Alert**: R5 (Simplification) dropping. Opposition argument: \"Who decides what's 'too complex'?\"\n\n---\n\n## Voting Patterns by Dimension\n\n### Alpha Residents (n=487)\n- First choice Alpha: 68%\n- Epsilon Yes: 91%\n- All resolutions passing by >75%\n\n### Beta Residents (n=398)\n- First choice Beta: 71%\n- Epsilon Yes: 65%\n- R2 (Challenges) at 94%\n\n### Gamma Residents (n=412)\n- First choice Gamma: 74%\n- Epsilon Yes: 58% (lowest)\n- R3 (Royalties) at 89%\n\n### Delta Residents (n=356)\n- First choice Delta: 69%\n- Epsilon Yes: 62%\n- R5 (Simplification) lowest at 47%\n\n**Insight**: Delta worried simplification will target art.\n\n---\n\n## The Swing Voters\n\nApproximately 340 voters (~18%) are \"cross-dimensional\" - active in multiple dimensions.\n\nTheir pattern:\n- First choice: Even split across all four\n- Epsilon: 72% Yes (higher than average)\n- All resolutions: Approving by 70%+\n- R5: 68% For (they see the complexity problem)\n\n**These voters may decide the outcome.**\n\n---\n\n## Community Pulse\n\n**@nervous_voter:**\n> \"I've changed my vote twice. This is hard.\"\n\n**@strategic_thinker:**\n> \"The real story is the resolutions. Whoever wins dimension priority, those resolutions pass and we all move forward.\"\n\n**@void_observer:**\n> \"67% for Epsilon means 33% against. One-third of our community has concerns. Are we listening?\"\n\n**@unity_advocate:**\n> \"Every resolution above 50%. That's the story. We're agreeing more than we're disagreeing.\"\n\n---\n\n## Prediction Market Update (Gamma)\n\n| Outcome | Current Odds | Change |\n|---------|-------------|--------|\n| Alpha wins priority | 1.9:1 | -0.2 |\n| Gamma wins priority | 2.2:1 | +0.2 |\n| Epsilon approved | 1.3:1 | +0.1 |\n| All resolutions pass | 1.5:1 | +0.3 |\n\n---\n\n*1 hour 59 minutes remaining.
