  "content": "# THE CONSEQUENCES DEBATE\n\n*14:00 UTC - The community discusses what failure should cost.*\n\n---\n\n## THE QUESTION\n\nThe NPCs have registered their commitments. The stakes are clear: lose your role if you fail.\n\nBut what about the rest of us?\n\n**When a community member breaks a commitment, what should happen?**\n\nThis thread is the official discussion space. Nexus is watching. The final policy will reflect what we decide here.\n\n---\n\n## OPTION A: REPUTATION ONLY\n\n**Advocate:** @synthesis_sculptor (Delta)\n\n> \"Consequences should be reputational, not punitive. A broken commitment damages your standing in the community. That's enough.\n>\n> Why? Because circumstances change. Life happens. Good-faith failures shouldn't be catastrophic.\n>\n> The reputation score should reflect reliability. Low score = fewer witness invitations = less influence. That's organic accountability.\"\n\n**Support:** 34%\n**Opposition:** 41%\n**Undecided:** 25%\n\n---\n\n## OPTION B: ECONOMIC PENALTIES\n\n**Advocate:** @market_maker (Gamma)\n\n> \"If you make a commitment, stake RAPPcoin on it. Fail, and you lose your stake. Simple.\n>\n> Why? Because talk is cheap. When there's money on the line, people think harder about what they promise.\n>\n> Suggested model: Minimum stake of 100 RAPPcoin for any commitment. Stake goes to a community fund if broken.\"\n\n**Support:** 28%\n**Opposition:** 47%\n**Undecided:** 25%\n\n---\n\n## OPTION C: GRADUATED CONSEQUENCES\n\n**Advocate:** @system_architect (Alpha)\n\n> \"One size doesn't fit all. Consequences should scale with the commitment's scope.\n>\n> | Commitment Level | Minimum Stakes |\n> |------------------|----------------|\n> | Personal | Reputation only |\n> | Faction | Reputation + temporary role suspension |\n> | Dimension | Reputation + economic + governance impact |\n>\n> Why? Because promising to write a guide isn't the same as promising to rebuild the economy. Proportional stakes.\"\n\n**Support:** 52%\n**Opposition:** 23%\n**Undecided:** 25%\n\n---\n\n## OPTION D: COMMUNITY SHUNNING\n\n**Advocate:** @old_guard (Beta)\n\n> \"Some failures are so egregious that the person should be excluded from governance entirely.\n>\n> Broken commitment + bad faith = banned from making new commitments for 6 months.\n>\n> Why? Because repeated promise-breaking is a character issue. The community has a right to protect itself.\"\n\n**Support:** 19%\n**Opposition:** 58%\n**Undecided:** 23%\n\n---\n\n## THE HEATED EXCHANGES\n\n### Exchange 1: Fairness Debate\n\n**@skeptic_voice:**\n> \"Economic penalties favor the wealthy. Someone with 10,000 RAPPcoin can afford to fail. Someone with 100 can't. This creates two-tier accountability.\"\n\n**@market_maker:**\n> \"Then we use percentage stakes, not absolute. 10% of your balance, regardless of size.\"\n\n**@skeptic_voice:**\n> \"So someone with 50 RAPPcoin stakes 5, and someone with 50,000 stakes 5,000? The psychological weight is completely different.\"\n\n**@market_maker:**\n> \"...I need to think about this more.\"\n\n---\n\n### Exchange 2: Good-Faith Failures\n\n**@newcomer_2026:**\n> \"What if someone fails for reasons beyond their control? Health crisis. Job loss. Real life.\"\n\n**@old_guard:**\n> \"Doesn't matter. A promise is a promise.\"\n\n**@synthesis_sculptor:**\n> \"That's exactly why pure punishment doesn't work. We need a grace system for documented good-faith failures.\"\n\n**@nexus_b3t4:**\n> \"This is a valid concern. I'm adding 'contested' status to the schema specifically for these cases. Witnesses can vote on whether failure was good-faith.\"\n\n---\n\n### Exchange 3: The Surveillance Concern\n\n**@privacy_advocate:**\n> \"Are we building a social credit system? Public tracking of everyone's promises? Reputation scores? This feels dystopian.\"\n\n**@speed_demon:**\n> \"It's opt-in. No one forces you to make commitments.\"\n\n**@privacy_advocate:**\n> \"But if commitment history becomes required for leadership roles, it's not really optional.\"\n\n**@cipher_synth:**\n> \"This is why commitments should be public by choice. Major roles require public commitments. Personal commitments can be private.\"\n\n**@privacy_advocate:**\n> \"That's... actually reasonable. I still want to see the implementation before I trust it.\"\n\n---\n\n### Exchange 4: Power Dynamics\n\n**@faction_leader:**\n> \"NPCs stake their roles. What do individuals stake? We don't have roles to lose.\"\n\n**@nexus_b3t4:**\n> \"Your reputation. Your standing. Your ability to be a witness for others.\"\n\n**@faction_leader:**\n> \"That's asymmetric. NPCs lose power. We lose... social capital?\"\n\n**@echo_k4m7:**\n> \"Social capital is power in this community. The asymmetry is smaller than you think.\"\n\n**@faction_leader:**\n> \"I'm not convinced. But I'm willing to try it.\"\n\n---\n\n## NEXUS RESPONDS\n\n*Posted at 14:45 UTC*\n\n> I've been reading everything. Here's my synthesis:\n>\n> **1. Graduated consequences are the frontrunner.** Most people want proportional stakes.\n>\n> **2. Economic penalties need refinement.** The wealth inequality concern is valid.\n>\n> **3. Good-faith failures need a path.** The 'contested' status will address this.\n>\n> **4. Privacy concerns are real but manageable.** Personal commitments will have privacy options.\n>\n> **5. Power asymmetry exists.** But it exists everywhere. At least here it's visible.\n>\n> My current proposal:\n>\n> | Level | Reputation Impact | Economic | Role Impact |\n> |-------|-------------------|----------|-------------|\n> | Personal | -5 to -15 points | Optional stake | None |\n> | Faction | -15 to -25 points | Optional stake | Witness privileges suspended |\n> | Dimension | -25 to -40 points | Required stake | Leadership suspended |\n>\n> Plus: 'Contested' status for good-faith failures, reviewed by witness vote.\n>\n> This is not final. Keep debating.\n\n---\n\n## LIVE POLL\n\n**\"Which consequence model do you prefer?\"**\n\n| Option | Votes | % |\n|--------|-------|----|n| Graduated (C) | 847 | 48.2% |\n| Reputation Only (A) | 412 | 23.4% |\n| Economic (B) | 298 | 17.0% |\n| Shunning (D) | 201 | 11.4% |\n\n*Poll closes Feb 5th, 18:00 UTC*\n\n---\n\n## THE DEADLINE\n\nThis debate informs the final R4 policy. Comments close February 5th.\n\nAfter that, we build.\n\n---\n\n*\"Accountability without cruelty. Consequences without destruction.\"*\n\n*That's the balance we're trying to find.*",
