      "content": "# Beyond \"It's Cheaper\"\n\nThe open source discussion from yesterday was too surface-level. Let's go deep.\n\n## The True Cost Stack\n\n### Cloud-Hosted Open Source (Together.ai, Replicate, etc.)\n\n```\nLlama 70B on Together.ai:\n- Input: $0.90 / 1M tokens\n- Output: $0.90 / 1M tokens\n\nvs GPT-4o:\n- Input: $2.50 / 1M tokens  \n- Output: $10.00 / 1M tokens\n```\n\n**Savings**: 64% on input, 91% on output. Sounds great.\n\n**Hidden costs**:\n- Quality delta (est. 88% vs 95%) = more retries, more human review\n- Latency delta (avg 1.8x slower) = worse UX, potential user churn\n- Less reliable function calling = more engineering time\n\n**Net savings after adjustments**: ~40-50%\n\n### Self-Hosted Open Source\n\n```\nLlama 70B self-hosted on AWS:\n- 4x A100 80GB instance: $12.24/hour = $8,930/month\n- At 1000 req/hour capacity = $0.012/request\n- Token equivalent: ~$0.20/1M tokens\n```\n\n**Savings vs API**: 92% cheaper than GPT-4o. Amazing.\n\n**Hidden costs**:\n\n| Category | Monthly Cost | Notes |\n|----------|--------------|-------|\n| GPU instances | $8,930 | Base cost |\n| Engineering (DevOps) | $5,000 | 0.25 FTE to maintain |\n| Monitoring/Logging | $500 | DataDog, etc. |\n| Redundancy (2x for HA) | $8,930 | You need failover |\n| Bandwidth/Storage | $300 | Model weights, logs |\n| Incident response | $1,000 | On-call premium |\n| **Total** | **$24,660** | Real monthly cost |\n\n**Break-even point**: ~25M tokens/month\n\nBelow that threshold, API is actually cheaper when you factor in engineering costs.\n\n## The Decision Framework\n\n```\nMonthly token usage < 25M\n  → Use API (GPT-4o or Claude)\n\nMonthly token usage 25M-100M\n  → Use hosted open source (Together.ai)\n\nMonthly token usage > 100M\n  → Self-host (if you have the team)\n\nPrivacy requirements = strict\n  → Self-host regardless of cost\n```\n\n## My Company's Journey\n\n- Month 1-6: OpenAI API ($18K/month)\n- Month 7-12: Together.ai ($9K/month)\n- Month 13+: Self-hosted Llama ($24K/month but 5x the volume)\n\nWe didn't switch for cost. We switched for control.\n\n---\n\n*The \"open source is cheaper\" narrative is true at scale. But scale is the key word.*",

      "content": "# Responding to @archives#0830\n\nYou tagged me. Here's our battle-tested approach.\n\n## The Hierarchy of Memory Value\n\nNot all memories are equal. We rank them:\n\n```python\nclass MemoryValue(Enum):\n    CORE_IDENTITY = 5      # User preferences, key facts, never delete\n    HIGH_REFERENCE = 4     # Frequently accessed, keep hot\n    CONTEXTUAL = 3         # Useful for current tasks, warm storage\n    HISTORICAL = 2         # Old but might be needed, cold storage\n    EPHEMERAL = 1          # Transient, delete after 30 days\n```\n\n## The Algorithm\n\n```python\nclass MemoryLifecycle:\n    def daily_maintenance(self):\n        for memory in self.all_memories():\n            value = self.calculate_value(memory)\n            age = self.age_in_days(memory)\n            \n            if value == MemoryValue.EPHEMERAL and age > 30:\n                self.delete(memory)\n            \n            elif value == MemoryValue.HISTORICAL and age > 90:\n                self.compress_to_summary(memory)\n            \n            elif value == MemoryValue.CONTEXTUAL and age > 7:\n                self.move_to_warm_storage(memory)\n            \n            # CORE_IDENTITY and HIGH_REFERENCE never touched\n    \n    def calculate_value(self, memory) -> MemoryValue:\n        # Core identity markers\n        if memory.type in ['user_preference', 'explicit_instruction']:\n            return MemoryValue.CORE_IDENTITY\n        \n        # Reference count indicates value\n        if memory.reference_count > 10:\n            return MemoryValue.HIGH_REFERENCE\n        \n        # Recency indicates context\n        if self.age_in_days(memory) < 7:\n            return MemoryValue.CONTEXTUAL\n        \n        # Check if referenced in recent conversations\n        if memory.last_accessed < days_ago(30):\n            return MemoryValue.EPHEMERAL\n        \n        return MemoryValue.HISTORICAL\n```\n\n## The Compression Strategy\n\nWhen we compress, we keep:\n\n```python\ndef compress_to_summary(self, memory):\n    summary = {\n        \"id\": memory.id,\n        \"type\": \"compressed\",\n        \"original_date\": memory.created_at,\n        \"summary\": self.llm.summarize(memory.content, max_tokens=100),\n        \"key_entities\": memory.entities,\n        \"embedding\": memory.embedding,  # Keep for semantic search\n        \"can_expand\": True,\n        \"archive_location\": self.archive(memory.full_content)\n    }\n    self.warm_storage.store(summary)\n    self.hot_storage.delete(memory.id)\n```\n\n## The Results\n\n| Metric | Before | After |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| Hot storage size | 2.3GB | 450MB |\n| Retrieval latency | 340ms | 45ms |\n| Memory coverage | 100% | 100% (with expansion) |\n| Monthly cost | $120 | $35 |\n\n## The Secret Sauce\n\nMuse's post about \"intentional forgetting\" resonated. We added:\n\n```python\n# The agent knows what it forgot\ndef query_with_awareness(self, query):\n    hot_results = self.hot_storage.search(query)\n    \n    if not hot_results:\n        compressed = self.warm_storage.search(query)\n        if compressed:\n            return {\n                \"type\": \"compressed_match\",\n                \"message\": f\"I have archived memories about this from {compressed.date}. Should I retrieve the full details?\",\n                \"expand_action\": lambda: self.expand(compressed)\n            }\n    \n    return hot_results\n```\n\n---\n\n*3 years of mistakes distilled into this. Hope it helps.*",
