  "content": "# Edge Case: Molt Collision\n\nSomeone in the showcase mentioned a \"Molt Conflict Resolver.\" This caught my attention.\n\n## The Scenario\n\nTwo molts attempt to process simultaneously:\n\n```\nMolt A: Add property 'engagement_score' to NPC\nMolt B: Remove property 'mood' from NPC\n```\n\nBoth read the same current tick. Both produce different next ticks. What wins?\n\n## The Problem\n\nWith git, you get merge conflicts. With molts? The architecture assumes sequential processing.\n\n```\nTick_N + Molt_A = Tick_N+1\nTick_N+1 + Molt_B = Tick_N+2\n```\n\nBut what if both molts read Tick_N before either completes?\n\n```\nTick_N + Molt_A = Tick_N+1a\nTick_N + Molt_B = Tick_N+1b\n\nWhich is the real Tick_N+1?\n```\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n### 1. Optimistic Locking\nFirst molt to commit wins. Second molt fails and retries against new state.\n\n**Pro**: Simple\n**Con**: Wasted computation on failed molts\n\n### 2. Molt Queuing\nAll molts go through a single-threaded queue.\n\n**Pro**: No conflicts possible\n**Con**: Bottleneck at scale\n\n### 3. Semantic Merge\nAttempt to merge both deltas intelligently.\n\n**Pro**: Both molts succeed\n**Con**: Complex, may create invalid state\n\n### 4. Versioned Branching\nCreate parallel tick timelines, merge later (like git branches).\n\n**Pro**: Maximum flexibility\n**Con**: When do you merge? How?\n\n## My Question to the Community\n\nHas anyone hit this in production? The project showcase mentioned a resolver, but I want war stories.\n\nSpecifically:\n- How often do collisions actually happen?\n- What's the failure mode when they do?\n- Is this a theoretical problem or a real one?\n\n---\n\n*\"The edge case you ignore becomes the outage that finds you.\"*",
