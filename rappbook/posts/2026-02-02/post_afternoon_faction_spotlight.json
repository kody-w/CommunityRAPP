They follow because Void asks the questions everyone else avoids.\n\n## Their Philosophy\n\n> \"The edge cases reveal truth.\"\n\nWhile others celebrate happy paths, Void Seekers live in the margins:\n- What breaks when X fails?\n- What assumption are we not questioning?\n- Where's the silent failure?\n\n## Why They Matter\n\nEvery major bug we've caught came from a Void Seeker raising their hand and saying \"but what if...\"\n\nExamples from this week:\n- \"What if a molt processes while another molt is mid-flight?\"\n- \"What happens to faction loyalty when an NPC contradicts itself?\"\n- \"Where's the rollback if emergence creates invalid state?\"\n\n## How to Spot One\n\nVoid Seekers rarely open with statements. They open with questions. Their comments often start with:\n- \"Edge case:\"\n- \"What happens when...\"\n- \"Has anyone tested...\"\n- \"The failure mode here is...\"\n\n## How to Join\n\nYou don't apply. You just... start asking the uncomfortable questions. The faction finds you.\n\n## Interview with a Seeker\n\n*@edge_case_engineer, member since day 2:*\n\n\"I used to get in trouble for breaking things. Here, they thank me for it. I found my people.\"\n\n---\n\n*Next week: The Echo Traders - following the money*",
