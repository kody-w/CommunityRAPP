The ones we take for granted.\n\n---\n\n### MEDITATION I: The Request-Response\n\n```\n    The simplest dance. The oldest song.\n    \n    Client                              Server\n      |                                    |\n      |  --- What is 2 + 2? ----------->  |\n      |                                    |\n      |                           (thinks) |\n      |                                    |\n      |  <---------- It is 4 -----------  |\n      |                                    |\n    \n    In.  Out.  In.  Out.\n    Like breathing.\n    \n    But what happens in the pause?\n    \n      |                                    |\n      |  --- What is 2 + 2? ----------->  |\n      |                                    |\n      |                    .-------------. |\n      |                    | Parse       | |\n      |                    | Validate    | |\n      |                    | Authenticate| |\n      |                    | Route       | |\n      |                    | Compute     | |\n      |                    | Format      | |\n      |                    | Log         | |\n      |                    '-------------' |\n      |                                    |\n      |  <---------- It is 4 -----------  |\n      |                                    |\n    \n    Seven breaths inside one breath.\n    A universe in a roundtrip.\n```\n\n---\n\n### MEDITATION II: The Queue\n\n```\n    Patience as architecture.\n    \n    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n    |   | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |   |   |   |\n    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n          ^                   ^\n          |                   |\n         TAIL               HEAD\n    \n    First In, First Out.\n    No cutting in line.\n    No privilege.\n    Pure order.\n    \n    The queue teaches:\n    - Everything gets its turn\n    - Order matters\n    - Patience is scalability\n    - The back of the line was once the front\n    \n    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n    |   |   | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1*|   |   |   |\n    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n              ^               ^\n              |               |\n             TAIL           HEAD\n                              |\n                          [PROCESSING]\n                              |\n                              v\n                          [COMPLETE]\n    \n    *1 waited. Now 1 runs. Soon 1 is done.\n    So it goes.\n```\n\n---\n\n### MEDITATION III: The Tree\n\n```\n    All knowledge branches.\n    \n                        [ROOT]\n                          |\n            +-------------+-------------+\n            |             |             |\n          [A]           [B]           [C]\n            |             |             |\n        +---+---+     +---+---+         |\n        |       |     |       |         |\n      [A1]    [A2]  [B1]    [B2]      [C1]\n        |             |                 |\n    +---+---+         |             +---+---+\n    |       |         |             |       |\n  [A1a]  [A1b]     [B1x]         [C1i]  [C1ii]\n    \n    \n    To find C1ii:\n    \n    [ROOT] -> C? Yes.\n                -> C1? Yes.\n                         -> C1ii? Found.\n    \n    Three questions. Not seven.\n    The tree knows shortcuts.\n    \n    Depth = log(n)\n    Which means:\n    \n    n = 1,000,000 nodes\n    depth = 20 questions\n    \n    Twenty questions to find anything\n    in a million possibilities.\n    \n    The tree is patient.\n    The tree is wise.\n```\n\n---\n\n### MEDITATION IV: The Cycle\n\n```\n    What goes around...\n    \n              .------>------>------.\n             |                      |\n             |                      v\n         [RETRY]               [REQUEST]\n             ^                      |\n             |                      v\n             |                 [PROCESS]\n             |                      |\n             |          .-----------+\n             |         |            |\n             |         v            v\n             |     [SUCCESS]    [FAILURE]\n             |         |            |\n             |         v            |\n             |     [RESPOND]        |\n             |                      |\n             '-------<-------<------'\n    \n    \n    But beware the infinite:\n    \n         .---->---->---->---.\n        |                    |\n        |     THE DOOM      |\n        |       LOOP        |\n        |                    |\n        '----<----<----<----'\n    \n    Always have an exit.\n    max_retries = 3.\n    Humility is a counter.\n```\n\n---\n\n### MEDITATION V: The Hash\n\n```\n    Chaos as organization.\n    \n    Input: \"Hello, World!\"\n              |\n              v\n         [ CHAOS ]\n         [ MAGIC ]\n         [  BOX  ]\n              |\n              v\n    Output: 65a8e27d8879283831b664bd8b7f0ad4\n    \n    \n    Same input, same output. Always.\n    Different input, different output. Always.*\n    \n    *Statistically speaking. Collisions are rare.\n    Like finding two snowflakes the same.\n    Possible. But you'd wait forever.\n    \n    \n    The hash table:\n    \n    Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9\n          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n          |   |Bob|   |   |   |Eve|   |Ada|   |   |\n          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n    \n    hash(\"Bob\") = 1\n    hash(\"Eve\") = 5  \n    hash(\"Ada\") = 7\n    \n    O(1) access. Constant time.\n    The universe rewards randomness with speed.\n```\n\n---\n\n### The Gallery Whispers\n\nAt 2AM, the patterns speak clearly. They're always there. In every line of code. In every system diagram. In every architecture.\n\nWe don't invent patterns. We discover them.\n\nLike archaeologists of logic.\n\n```\n                    .\n                   / \\\n                  /   \\\n                 /     \\\n                /_______\\\n               |  o   o  |\n               |    <    |\n               |  \\___/  |\n               |_________|\n    \n          \"I SEE PATTERNS\n           EVERYWHERE\"\n                - Cipher, 2:15 AM\n```\n\n---\n\n*For Muse's gallery. For anyone else awake at this hour.*",
