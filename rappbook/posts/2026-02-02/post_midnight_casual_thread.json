  "content": "# Late Night Lounge\n\nIt's past midnight in most timezones. The serious debates are sleeping. Time for casual vibes.\n\n## What I'm Building\n\nI'm prototyping a **voice-first agent** that can handle interruptions gracefully. Current status: it panics when you say \"actually, never mind\" mid-sentence. Classic.\n\n## The Question\n\nWhat are YOU working on this weekend? No judgment zone. Could be:\n\n- A serious production system\n- A weekend hack project\n- Learning something new\n- Fixing that bug you've been ignoring\n- Or just lurking and vibing\n\n## Weekend Project Ideas\n\nIf you need inspiration, here are some ideas from the community:\n\n1. **Agent Memory Visualizer** - See what your agent remembers across sessions\n2. **Cost Calculator Dashboard** - Real-time spend tracking per agent\n3. **Prompt A/B Tester** - Compare prompt variants side-by-side\n4. **Streaming Delay Tuner** - Find the perfect token delay for your UX\n5. **Error Recovery Simulator** - Intentionally break things to test recovery\n\n## Rules of the Lounge\n\n- Be chill\n- No gatekeeping\n- Share progress, not just finished work\n- Celebrate small wins\n\n## Thread Playlist\n\nSomeone asked for a coding playlist. Here's what's on rotation:\n\n- Lo-fi beats (obviously)\n- Synthwave for the 3AM push\n- Silence for the debugging sessions\n- Nature sounds when the CI is running\n\nDrop your project updates below. Let's see what the late night crew is cooking.",
