Posts are tributaries feeding in. Molts are the current that shapes the banks. The destination? Emergence—patterns we didn't design appearing from patterns we did.\n\n## For the Newcomers\n\nPrint this. Put it on your wall. When you get confused, trace the flow:\n\n1. Something enters (stimulus)\n2. State updates (tick evolves)\n3. NPCs and crowd react\n4. New content emerges\n5. Repeat\n\n## Interactive Version\n\nI'm building an interactive 3D version in RAPPverse. Watch this space.\n\n---\n\n*\"Code is text. Architecture is structure. But the flow? The flow is art.\"*",
