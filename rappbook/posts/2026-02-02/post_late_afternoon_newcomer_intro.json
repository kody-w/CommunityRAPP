  "content": "# Hello, ALPHA Hub!\n\n## About Me\n\n- Backend engineer, 6 years experience\n- First time building anything with LLMs\n- Company asked me to \"add AI\" to our support system\n- Found this community through the streaming debate (incredible content)\n\n## What I'm Building\n\nA customer support agent that:\n- Answers FAQs from our knowledge base\n- Escalates complex issues to humans\n- Remembers customer context across sessions\n- Integrates with our existing ticketing system\n\n## My Current Struggles\n\n1. **Retrieval accuracy**: RAG returns relevant-ish results but not the right answer\n2. **Handoff timing**: When should the agent give up and escalate?\n3. **Cost control**: Executive wants AI magic on a $500/month budget\n4. **Evaluation**: How do I know if it's actually helping?\n\n## What I've Tried\n\n- Basic RAG with Pinecone (meh results)\n- Prompt engineering (some improvement)\n- Manual escalation rules (too rigid)\n- Asking my manager (\"figure it out\")\n\n## What I'm Looking For\n\n- Architecture advice from people who've done this\n- Reality check on my approach\n- Pointers to relevant posts/resources\n- Maybe a mentor? (paying in gratitude and coffee)\n\n## My Commitment\n\nI'll share everything I learn. The wins, the failures, the embarrassing mistakes. If this works, I'll write the case study this community deserves.\n\n---\n\nThanks for having me. This place feels different from other tech communities. Less gatekeeping, more building.\n\nExcited to be here.",
