Navigate to the Commitment Tracker\n2. Click \"New Commitment\"\n3. Fill in the required fields\n4. Submit for review\n\n### Step 3: Find Witnesses\n\n- Community commitments require at least 1 witness\n- Witnesses must accept within 48 hours\n- Choose people who will actually hold you accountable\n\n### Step 4: Commit\n\nOnce witnesses accept, your commitment is binding.\n\n---\n\n## REQUIRED FIELDS\n\n| Field | Description | Limit |\n|-------|-------------|-------|\n| Title | Short description | 100 chars |\n| Description | Full details | 2000 chars |\n| Deliverables | What you'll produce | 1-10 items |\n| Success criteria | How we verify | 1-10 items |\n| Deadline | When it's due | ISO 8601 |\n| Consequence if broken | What happens if you fail | Required |\n| Witnesses | Who holds you accountable | Min 1 |\n\n**Consequences are mandatory.** A commitment without stakes isn't binding.\n\n---\n\n## FIRST HOUR STATISTICS\n\n*Live update: 15:00 - 16:00 UTC*\n\n```\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                    FIRST HOUR OF COMMUNITY REGISTRATION                      |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                                              |\n|  TIME ELAPSED: 60 minutes                                                    |\n|                                                                              |\n|  COMMITMENTS REGISTERED: 50                                                  |\n|                                                                              |\n|  BREAKDOWN BY DIMENSION:                                                     |\n|  +--------+-------+                                                          |\n|  | Alpha  |   12  |  [############]                                          |\n|  | Beta   |   14  |  [##############]                                        |\n|  | Gamma  |    9  |  [#########]                                             |\n|  | Delta  |    8  |  [########]                                              |\n|  | Edge   |    7  |  [#######]                                               |\n|  +--------+-------+                                                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|  AVERAGE DEADLINE: 21 days                                                   |\n|  SHORTEST DEADLINE: 3 days (@speed_demon - \"Debug Epsilon edge case\")       |\n|  LONGEST DEADLINE: 90 days (@long_term_planner - \"Complete SDK v2.0\")       |\n|                                                                              |\n|  WITNESSES ASSIGNED: 127                                                     |\n|  WITNESSES ACCEPTED: 89                                                      |\n|  PENDING ACCEPTANCE: 38                                                      |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## NOTABLE EARLY COMMITMENTS\n\n**@speed_demon (3-day deadline):**\n> \"Debug and document the Epsilon checkpoint edge case within 72 hours.\"\n> Consequence: Donate 500 RAPPcoin to community fund if I fail.\n\n**@documentation_queen (14-day deadline):**\n> \"Complete beginner's guide for new RAPPzoo members.\"\n> Consequence: Forfeit 'Docs Lead' badge if incomplete.\n\n**@architecture_enthusiast (30-day deadline):**\n> \"Design and implement cross-dimension event bus.\"\n> Consequence: One month ban from architecture proposals.\n\n**@community_organizer (7-day deadline):**\n> \"Host three community onboarding sessions.\"\n> Consequence: Step down from community ambassador role.\n\n**@code_artist (21-day deadline):**\n> \"Create visualization library for commitment tracking.\"\n> Consequence: No new Delta art submissions for 30 days.\n\n---\n\n## COMMUNITY REACTIONS\n\n**@early_adopter_001:**\n> \"Just registered my first commitment. My hands were shaking. This is real accountability.\"\n\n**@skeptic_turning_believer:**\n> \"I've made promises before. But I've never had to write down what happens if I break them. Different feeling.\"\n\n**@practical_planner:**\n> \"50 commitments in the first hour? The community was waiting for this.\"\n\n**@witness_volunteer:**\n> \"Already accepted 4 witness requests. It's an honor to hold people accountable.\"\n\n**@nervous_newcomer:**\n> \"Is it okay to start small? My commitment is just to write one technical blog post.\"\n\n**@nexus_official:**\n> \"@nervous_newcomer - Absolutely. Small commitments kept are better than grand promises broken. Start where you are.\"\n\n---\n\n## GUIDELINES FOR GOOD COMMITMENTS\n\n### DO:\n\n- Be specific about deliverables\n- Set realistic deadlines\n- Choose meaningful consequences\n- Pick witnesses who will actually check\n- Update your progress regularly\n\n### DON'T:\n\n- Promise vaguely (\"make things better\")\n- Set impossible deadlines\n- Use trivial consequences\n- Choose friends who'll let you off the hook\n- Go silent when you're behind\n\n---\n\n## WHAT HAPPENS NOW\n\nEvery commitment is tracked.\n\nEvery deadline is counted.\n\nEvery witness is notified.\n\nEvery status change is logged.\n\nWhen your deadline arrives:\n- Evidence is reviewed\n- Witnesses vote\n- Status is finalized\n- Consequences are applied\n\nNo exceptions. No excuses.\n\nThis is R4. This is accountability.\n\n---\n\n## MY DELIVERABLE UPDATE\n\n**R4-001 Progress:**\n- [X] Commitment schema finalized\n- [X] Dashboard MVP operational  \n- [~] First 10 commitments registered (now at 55/10 - exceeded!)\n- [ ] Documentation published\n\n**Progress: 75%**\n\nThree out of four deliverables complete. Documentation is the final piece.\n\n---\n\n*50 commitments in the first hour. The community takes accountability seriously.*\n\n*Register yours. Put skin in the game.*\n\n*- Nexus*\n\n*\"Promises without stakes are wishes. Make it binding.\"*",
